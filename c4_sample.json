{"text":"Unfair Dismissal laws even the playing field between workers and companies and can provide vulnerable workers with a much-needed platform to seek redress for their dismissal. The outcome of Unfair Dismissal applications will reflect a consideration and balancing of the worker\u2019s interests against the company\u2019s interests; everyone will get a fair go.\nUnfair Dismissal will have occurred when a worker has been dismissed from their job and that dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, and was not in fact a case of genuine redundancy where the company no longer requires the person\u2019s job to be performed by anyone.\na worker\u2019s resignation was forced by the conduct of the company or the worker was given no practical option but to resign.\nany other matters the Commission sees as relevant.\nIf a worker\u2019s application is successful, a remedy that he or she may receive may be reinstatement of their previous job. If reinstatement is not appropriate, the worker will receive compensation for their lost income.\nSimply because litigation has arisen as a result of dismissal is not enough to amount to being inappropriate to reinstate (Wark v Melbourne City Toyota (1999)). If a worker is granted an order for reinstatement, he or she will be appointed to their former position, or a new position where the terms and conditions of that position are no less favourable than that former position.\nIf you feel that you have been unfairly dismissed from your job and wish to make an application to the Fair Work Commission, as a general rule, you have 21 days after the date of dismissal to do so. Should you require assistance or advice at any stage of your application to the Fair Work Commission, MKI Legal\u2019s experience in employment relations disputes means your situation will be handled cost-effectively and efficiently to limit any further financial and emotional strain of being dismissed from your job."}

{"text":"If we haven\u2019t yet met, Hi! My name is Corinna and I\u2019m the blogger behind For My Love Of. Please, stop by and check things out sometime! Today I\u2019m here to share an easy craft- A Handmade Tribal Mobile!\nI\u2019m sure you know, but there\u2019s been a fun surgence of tribal inspired decor hitting the scene. I wanted to make something inspired by this latest trend, but go off the beaten path a bit. This mobile is easy to create and can be made with minimal supplies!\nDowel rods, hand saw, jute twine. Optional: Gold leaf supplies and acrylic paints.\nYou\u2019ll need to start off by cutting the dowel rods to the desired length. My dowel rods were 12 inches and I cut them into thirds (4 inches). I knew I wanted to use gold leaf on them so I stuck thumb tacks into an end of each rod to make holding them easier.\nTo allow the finish to dry undisturbed on the rods, I cut small holes into these little cardboard containers. I had actually started this project with a different intention. I wanted to make a starburst clock but didn\u2019t have enough dowel rods to get out of the nautical feel. Talk about a lucky mistake!\nIf I find a solution to my failed sunburst clock, I\u2019ll be sure to update you guys! But for now, while the finish dries on the dowel rods, you can pull out a clip board and about 2 yards of jute twine.\nFold the twine in half and tie a knot to create a loop to hang the mobile from. Slip the knot underneath the clip of the clipboard.\nUsing overhand knots, tie the dowels onto the twine. I tied them so that the overlap of the knots were on the same side (backside for me) and tied the ends into one ooverhand knot then cut off the excess . If you need a reference for common knots, check out my How To Macrame \u2013 5 Essential Knots post!\nI chose to hang mine on the end of one of my DIY Gold Bamboo Curtain Rods. I am completely loving the feel of bohemian decor right now and I feel like this adds a dose of that feel to our living room.\nIf you enjoyed this project, be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and Pinterest to keep updated with my progress decorating our Living Room!"}
{"text":"Is there a specific industry or trade you are interested working in? It will save you money, in the long run, to get a certificate instead of a four-year degree that might not even be relevant for what you want to do as your career. There are a lot of high paying jobs that don\u2019t require traditional higher education. Do your research and see if earning a certificate is the right choice for you.\nAn apprenticeship is a great option because it lets you be a student, get on the job training, and get paid while doing it! You will completely avoid taking out student loans, which will save you money in the long run, while learning a relevant trade that will result in a high paying job. Apprenticeships can last anywhere from two to four years and you must have a high school diploma to be accepted into most of them.\nThough it is still higher education, getting a degree online is less traditional and usually more cost-effective than attending a regular four-year institution. In addition to being a money saving alternative, most people who take online college courses are also working full-time, so the class times are very flexible. Keep in mind that taking online courses also requires discipline as you have to use your free time to learn, study and complete homework.\nJoining the military can allow you to get specialized training in a lot of fields for a reduced amount, or even completely free. You can even attend ROTC programs in high school to see what military life is like first. The military is also a good option if you aren\u2019t sure what career path you want to take yet. They will give you assessments to help you find where you fit best.\nIf you do plan on getting your higher education at a four-year college, but not sure what you want to major in, a community college is a great option. (If that is your plan, make sure your credits from the community college will transfer to the University of your choice.) It is also a great option if you just want to earn a certificate or an Associate\u2019s Degree. Compared to a four-year college which can cost you thousands of dollars in tuition, a community college can cost around one thousand for in-state tuition. Even if you end up needing student loans, it will be a much more manageable amount to pay off. If you do choose to transfer to a University, attending a community college first could cut your tuition in half.\nNeed some extra funds for your online classes?

So, try to check out a couple of samples before deciding which is best to follow.\nIn a more professional way, your business plan should contain essential things including the cost of business start-up, projected labor expenses, transportation costs, prices of plumbing tools, analysis about clients and finally the goal of the plumbing business.\nAfter creating a professional business plan for your proposed plumbing business, generating sufficient start-up funds could be the next thing on your mind.\nOne important thing is to determine the amount you need for your business start-up while another is to find the means for generating it.\nYou can look for investors who are ready to channel investments into small businesses and provided you have a high-profile business plan already, you could be lucky to capture the interest of such investors.\nIf there are no investors interested in your business plan, you can try contacting a business partner.\nBesides being able to manage businesses, such a person should be highly connected with the local business market and should know how to generate funds for small businesses.\nTo obtain a license for your plumbing business, you\u2019ll be required to provide genuine business information which can include the business name and several other details.\nBefore proceeding to business registration, try to find out the rules and regulations guiding plumbing services in your area as you\u2019ll be required to verify that your plumbing business will not violate any of these rules and regulations.\nYou may not consider this compulsory but if you want your business to appear more professional, you\u2019ll have to equip it with an office where potential and existing clients can always get in touch with you.\nImportantly, consider a suitable location for your office space.\nIf you must be a successful plumber with many clients, you\u2019ll have to socialize yourself precisely by contacting people frequently, visiting them at home and workplaces and inquiring to know whether there are plumbing defects they need to correct.\nBesides speaking to clients over the phone, you may have to establish an online medium for communicating with them.\nBy socializing yourself, you\u2019ll find it easy to capture dozens of new clients for your plumbing business.\nEven if you readily boast a sophisticated level of plumbing experience, you still need to visit clients regularly to make them know you\u2019re always available to them.\nAlso, try to weigh your managerial ability especially if you\u2019ll be hiring others to carry out plumbing tasks on your behalf.\nManaging such people effectively is very essential and it is one of the skills you should incorporate into your plumbing business.\nPlumbing is subject to change in construction methods, plumbing fixtures, prices of supplies and other things that pertain to the business.\nDon\u2019t assume a particular plumbing method will forever remain in vogue.\nTry as much as possible to obtain the latest plumbing information probably by taking on relevant education courses, participating in trade shows and reading business magazines.\nIf you\u2019re not adopting an effective marketing strategy, you might not compete fairly with the other plumbers in your area.\nIn addition to word-of-mouth marketing, you should put in more marketing efforts probably by establishing a business brand and logo, creating social media presence for your business and using a quality website to attract new clients.\nIt\u2019s very possible that there are other professional plumbers in your area and as part of your effort to stand out from the crowd, endeavor to find out what your competitors do.\nIn other words, be familiar with the pricing plans and plumbing methods adopted by your competitors.\nAdditionally, check out the kinds of offers, strategies or plans they use in retaining existing clients and attracting new clients.\nThink about the enticing thing your competitors are doing but not properly. Gear your effort towards doing this thing in the most enticing way.\nPerhaps, your competitors are offering discounts on the plumbing tools sold to their clients but they aren\u2019t doing that handsomely.\nConsider how you could do better than your competitors in this regard. However, you must be sure you aren\u2019t pleasing your customers at your own expense.\nAdvisably, do not offer discounts that will make you run out of business profit."}

{"text":"If you are interested in keeping your yard looking great year-round, then CVS Home is the place to go. If you are like most people, you just don't have the time for fertilizing, weeding, lawn mowing and all that goes into creating a beautiful, well maintained lawn. CVS Home has become the popular choice for customers that need to find low cost lawn care services in Hancock from the most trusted, local professionals.\nWhether you own your own riding mower and enjoy mowing your lawn, but you'd like some help with the more difficult lawn maintenance tasks, or you would like to hire a Hancock lawn care company to take care of your whole yard for you, you've come to the right place. We recommend hiring an experienced professional to take care of all of your lawn care in Hancock, as it's usually the most efficient, affordable, and easiest solution for homeowners and property managers.\nLawn mowing service - typical Hancock lawn mowing costs range from about $35 to $85 per visit, with one time service costing more, and more often service costing less. The frequency of cuts will depend on the type of grass that you have installed, as well as your personal preference and budget.\nSeeding - average Hancock lawn seeding costs are around $500 - $900 depending on the size of your lawn. Whether you hire a professional, or do it yourself, seeding during the fall is recommended to keep your lawn lush, green and healthy. You can save about $200 by seeding you own lawn, but you need to make sure to use the right seeds for your lawn and factor in a few other variables, which is just one of the reasons that we recommend hiring a local professional that's experienced with the grass types in the Hancock area.\nFertilization - the average Hancock lawn fertilization costs around $99 to $400 for an average sized yard. You should expect to spend around $.03 to $.05 per square ft, and the price will go down per square foot for larger yards. Fertilizer should be applied around four times per year, and more often during the high growth season.

Organic fertilizer is also an option, although the cost will be slightly higher compared to the other types.\nLeaf removal - average costs for leaf removal in Hancock are about $150 and $250 for the typical job. Removing leaves from your lawn is important to maintaining a healthy lawn, as fallen leaves can block sunlight and your grass can die.

One other option is to have your leaves vacuumed and chopped up and turned into mulch.\nAeration - lawn aeration costs in Hancock usually cost $75 to $175 depending on the type of aeration and the size of your lawn. It's recommended to do it in the spring, and it helps nutrients, water and air reach the soil so that it can stay healthy. If your grass has heavy traffic from pets or kids playing then the need for aeration increases.\nSprinkler system maintenance & repair - the average cost for sprinkler system repair in Hancock is around $100 to $300. Having a well maintained sprinkler system that evenly waters your lawn at the right time each day is essential to keeping your grass in tip top shape. You can get help with all types of irrigation systems including Toro, Nelson, Rainbird and Hunter and more.\nIt's important to ask about the experience of your local Hancock lawn care company's employees before you select the company for your job.

{"text":"ARTIST: Bruce Springsteen & \u2018the Other Band\u2019 DATE: April 11, 1993 VENUE: Stadio Bentegodi, Verona, Italy LABEL: A HOJO Production NOTE: Pro-shot partial concert, includes a bonus track marked with an asterisk.\nperformance showcases the \u201cOther Band\u201d after a year on the road and the DVD reveals a very competent musical outfit. The band could never hope to engender the same emotional connection with the fans as its E-Street equivalents but no-one in Verona that night would have thought anything other than they had seen a great show; the encore in particular is excellent with \u201cMy Beautiful Reward\u201d and \u201c Workin\u2019 On the Highway\u201d being notable highlights. Special mention too for a very nice acoustic version of \u201cThunder Road\u201d.\nAs is the norm with HOJO, the production is of high quality and the Shakespearian theme is a nice touch. The video is excellent, particularly considering its age, and contains enough audience shots to ensure it doesn\u2019t feel sterile. Unfortunately, the audio doesn\u2019t quite reach the same standard. HOJO cleaned up the original audio to remove the hiss which marred the overall sound. It was then remixed with audience recordings to add a little atmosphere and try to overcome the distortion on the original source, presumably as a result of the audio level being set too high when it was recorded. The extent to which the distortion is still noticeable and will irritate may depend on viewers\u2019 equipment or audio set-up; this reviewer found it difficult to listen to at certain moments on his PC but experienced no such problems when viewing the show through the magic of television.\nWhatever the case, the finished mix is a significant improvement on the original source recording and audio collectors should note it has also been made available on CD. For the purists, the original soundtrack is available as optional audio on the DVD.\nThe bonus video features a performance from Oslo on the final night of the 1993 European tour. Featuring Warren Kaye, aka roadie \u201cChainsaw, on guitar and lead vocals, it is, frankly, scary and shouldn\u2019t be viewed by anyone with a weak heart- ever wanted to see Roy Bittan or Shayne Fontayne \u201cheadbanging\u201d?!

{"text":"Okay, I admit that I stayed after Blogworld for this Postiecon 07 in Las Vegas. I didn't know what to expect but now that it is over, I can put the weird cult like atmosphere aside and write about it. I had flashbacks to early days of eBay and some of their fan events.\nFull disclosures. This blog is not sponsored in any way by anyone. It's just my longtime eight year old web forum persona here. I didn't receive anything from Izea AKA PayPerPost AKA SocialSpark other than the usual convention stuff like a shirt and drink holders. I even bought my own lunch. I've never been paid for a blog post anywhere. I did use PayPerPost in the past as an advertiser and am still not sure of the results, if any.\nPayPerPost was the controversial system built by Ted Murphy in 2006. It allowed bloggers to make money by posting about who knows what. Advertisers paid for this. Many bloggers used it in a deceitful way of writing about stuff without saying they were paid for it. And many other bloggers always disclosed it. Controversy ensued. And I can't help but smirk at the irony of the name being Postiecon when some thought that the idea of hidden paid blog posts was a con for readers. Enough said.\nIzea became the name for the parent company. And now another step away from PayPerPost and nail in the coffin of it was unveiled at Postiecon 07 and it is called Social Spark. No, it's not the dating website that had consumer complaints against it. I assume the domain changed hands for this new venture (but I don't know anything about that for sure) which is due to be released in January 2008. The socialspark website just goes to payperpost for now. In the end, it distances the system away from what it was and that's a smart move.\nEverything is more open, even to those not logged in. There does not seem to be any privacy anymore. We can see all the good and bad posts and ad buys out there. They have extensive demographic information which will mislead a lot of people. The demographics come from the members of this marketplace. It is not data on a large swatch of people like MySpace or Facebook. Data on a bunch of people selling their words for a few bucks may not be an advertisers typical customer. It is a social network for bloggers and advertisers. Does a major corporation want to be social with a woman who blogs about mosquitoe nets, Costa Rica and breast implants in the same day for $5?\nThere seem to be positives for both advertisers and bloggers. Advertisers can inspect bloggers more closely and even have a price driven downward from what they originally set.\nThere is a marketplace for free posts. A blogger can get sponsorship on their blog. They can put annoying ads of all kinds over their blog for a set fee per day. In the best aspect I saw, a blogger can request a job or indicate interest in advertisers. This indicates possible passion and interest which is good for both sides. Advertisers have more control over their campaigns as well. Overall, I think the improvements are better for advertisers than bloggers. And that's what is needed to grow this kind of company. You can't cater everything to a small percentage of the bloggers on the net, the most successful of which says they make less than 20k in over a year.\nAll links will be \"no follow\" and have the same disclosure badge. This has several aspects to it.\nIt eliminates those that hide their posts.\nIt eliminates advertises looking for link love. They will have to want all that traffic from small blogs that write about nothing and everything in the world for a few bucks. And from what I heard today, most of which traffic is probably from marketplace bloggers praising each other.\nIt makes it easy for Google to find one consistent graphic and just nuke all those websites. One could argue the no follow tag link will make it look better however because it passes no credibility. But does an advertiser want to pay for an endorsement that says \"no endorsement\" behind the scenes?\nSome negative things about Alexa and Google were said at this event. Alexa stats are skewed to people who have a toolbar installed. They are gamed and falsely inflate tech related companies who know about Alexa. So how is a ranking system from within a network of paid to post bloggers praising each other any better? Unknown. It's just a ranking of which paid blogs are the most trafficked and have a widget installed.\nAs for the backlash against Google changes lately. They created Pagerank and they own it. They can change it any time they want. Other companies and people opted to use it to make or save money and they have to accept the risk of it changing at any time.\nBlogworld Expo and New Media Show Day Two is winding down. This was actually day one of the main conference. I'm counting the Executive and Entrepreneur day in my count. The show has continued to impress me as far as production, huge signs and technical aspects. You have to buy your own food today but at least guests are not paying for it in the cost of the pass. You do your own thing. There are pluses and minuses with that concept compared to conferences where you get box lunches. And those boxes that may or may not make you sick. I've spent a couple of past conference days at Search Engine Strategies either in the bathroom too often or just not feeling right. And when you see a sandwich with mayo put out at 9:30 in the morning for lunch several hours later, well you figure it out. But none of this is relevant with Blogworld Expo.\nThe morning keynote was with Wordpress Matt. (He doesn't need anymore links as any blogger knows). It was okay but nothing exciting. No news or real insight about anything. Matt is not a real dynamic speaker. And not everyone can be a great speaker so it's no big deal. I know I'd be horrible.\nThe morning session I chose was Monetizing Your Blog which featured Jeremy Schoemaker AKA Shoemoney. He is always an entertaining and a frank speaker who is bound to share something interesting that you can take away and use for yourself. I've seen and met him briefly a few times now at conferences. There is a select few people that I always look for on speaker schedules, knowing that something interesting will come out of the session, and he is one of them.\nThe show floor opened up and it was a pretty good one. There were four wide rows and it easy to maneuver through the crowds. Sometimes SES and Pubcon show floors are so cramped, it becomes a frustrating experience trying to schmooze. As usual, there are many new companies I've never heard of and will probably never hear of again. But that is normal. New companies launch and blow all their money on a show booth hoping to be bought, get VC funding or hit it big. Most of them just fade away leaving only pens and decaying signage in landfills to prove they ever existed.\nMore afternoon sessions filled up the day. All were good, well paced and without sales pitches. The final panel included heads of Technorati, Pajamas Media, Weblogs Inc, B5media and the founder of Blogger. It kept me awake but it was nothing noteworthy.\nThe first day of Blogworld Expo is underway. It is actually the Executive and Entrepreneur day today which costs much more than the two regular days on Thursday and Friday.\nThus far, it is an impressive show and beyond expectations. We'll see if it sustains itself when the masses join tomorrow. Well organized with lots of neat systems to help it run smoothly. Computer registration to reduce the check in line time. (Flashback to Pubcon and SES troubles in that area.) Nice booklet. Tons of signage. Good food, drinks and snacks. Lunch was hot with real silverware and cloth napkins. Also quite different from SES and Pubcon.\nSessions were solid. No sales pitches thus far. All just pure information and discussion at a high level. The only real disappointment was Huffington's cancellation for another higher priced appearance in NY."}

{"text":"Mamed Mamedov is regarded among the seven distinguished artists of the 1960s, whose names are closely associated with one of the brightest periods in the history of Turkmen painting. Mamed Mamedov, Durdy Bairamov, Shajan Akmuhammedov, Stanislav Babikov, Gulnazar Bekmuradov, Chary Amangeldyev and Juma Jumadurdy, whose families were on friendly terms, were spiritually close and offered each other their helpful advice. The permanent collection of the Museum of Fine Arts boasts the portrait of these artists, The Seven by Kakajan Oraznepesov.\nWhen choosing his profession, Mamed, who was brought up in the Tejen Children's Home, entered Turkmen State Art School. It was a fateful decision, painting fascinated him deeply. On leaving the school, he studied at I. E. Repin Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in the city of Leningrad.\nThe portrait of composer Nury Halmamedov is highly symbolic in his oeuvre. This painting reveals the commonality between the master artist and the great composer. There is a large array of works by Turkmen painters depicting Nury Halmamedov; however one look at Mamed Mamedov's painting is enough to remember it forever. In the same way, to hear a piece of music by Nury Halmamedov once means to become a true lover of his works.\nMamed Mamedov had much in common with the outstanding composer. They were the best friends, the boys, who lived in a children's home in the stern post-war period, and both possessed natural talent and became famous while alive. They died young at the peak of their abilities, not having the chance to create more. But they truly left their mark in the national culture.\nMamed Mamedov depicted the composer with his cheek touching a mulberry \ufffd a powerful and vigorous tree, reflecting the maestro's personality. The artist managed to accurately capture Nury Halmamedov's charisma and the strength of his musical talent with red, yellow and brown, dominating the painting.\nIt was typical of the many-faceted artist to create paintings differently from others. For instance, still-life paintings (celebrating the bounties of fertile Turkmen land) by Turkmen painters are a riot of colour, while his still-life painting shows a black dish exquisitely contrasted with white grapes and ruby pomegranates. He was able to see the beauty in everything and was incredibly skillful at painting.\nWhen a student at the Repin Institute, Mamed Mamedov created the easel painting Opening of the Karakum Canal as his graduation work. He was very much aware that water was held sacred in his native country. Therefore, in his painting, dwellers from all near-by villages hurry to witness the man-made miracle that brings precious water.\nIt seems that the painting The Prayer for Water, which was produced four years after the painting Opening of the Turkmen Canal should be placed first chronologically. In this context, it could be possible to evaluate the importance of the Karakum Canal for the Turkmen nation. The Prayer for Water shows the drought that threatens lives of the people in desert areas. Women and children severely suffering from thirst desperately pray for rain. It all happened in the past, but it is different now.\nGoing through the archive documents, the artist's spouse Galina Mamedova found a small piece of the drawing that shows the knee of a woman, bending down and holding her hands up. Mamed Mamedov created the pencil drawing approximately in 1954. Consequently, the idea of creating the painting The Prayer for Water came to the artist in his student years.\nThe scientific and technological advances totally amazed elderly people, and the artist loved to reflect the theme. A graphic painting by Mamed Mamedov features an old man, who has never flown by airplane before. Clutching tightly his dutar to his chest, he feels tense and yet curious: the huge iron machine flies like a bird. A passenger next to him reads a book and is perfectly at ease.\nThe painting The Talk about Universe has a touch of fantasy: the large disk-shaped moon, silver shades, slightly elongated figures, and clothes somewhat resembling the attire of ancient Greek philosophers. Possibly, these serve to highlight the inner emotions of old men, who have just come to know about other worlds and feel slightly confused by the new information.\nSocial realism, which was the main genre of painting at that time, did not prevent Mamed Mamedov from making the most of his talent. He devoted his fine easel paintings to working people, and expanded his collection by painting portraits of outstanding contemporaries and ordinary people alike.\nProduced in vivid and cheerful colors, the painting Irrigators dates back to 1985. It conveys much air and light, and the atmosphere of collective labor. And at the same time, the painting strikingly reveals the peasants' faces not clearly depicted. This is the artist's last and unfinished work. Working on it, he died untimely aged 47 in his studio at the hands of his colleagues Galina Saurova and Alexander Saurov.\nTo mark the 80th anniversary of Mamed Mamedov's birth, the Museum of Fine Arts features a large exhibition of his works in several halls. The organizers entitled it From Idea to Realization, because aside from paintings and graphic works, the exhibition displays sketches with ideas that were never to come true. The section of pencil sketches is a big draw for the Academy's students, who highly appreciate the opportunity to trace how the great master created his painting. Visitors to the exhibition found real enjoyment in exploring Mamed Mamedov's creative legacy \ufffd patriotic, striking and talented."}

{"text":"\"Distinct roles of c-Jun N-terminal kinase isoforms in neurite initiati\" by Monia Barnat, Herve Enslen et al.\nc-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (comprising JNK1-3 isoforms) are members of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) family, activated in response to various stimuli including growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. Their activation is facilitated by scaffold proteins, notably JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP1). Originally considered to be mediators of neuronal degeneration in response to stress and injury, recent studies support a role of JNKs in early stages of neurite outgrowth, including adult axonal regeneration. However, the function of individual JNK isoforms, and their potential effector molecules, remained unknown. Here, we analyzed the role of JNK signaling during axonal regeneration from adult mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, combining pharmacological JNK inhibition and mice deficient for each JNK isoform and for JIP1. We demonstrate that neuritogenesis is delayed by lack of JNK2 and JNK3, but not JNK1. JNK signaling is further required for sustained neurite elongation, as pharmacological JNK inhibition resulted in massive neurite retraction. This function relies on JNK1 and JNK2. Neurite regeneration of jip1(-\/-) DRG neurons is affected at both initiation and extension stages. Interestingly, activated JNKs (phospho-JNKs), as well as JIP1, are also present in the cytoplasm of sprouting or regenerating axons, suggesting a local action on cytoskeleton proteins. Indeed, we have shown that JNK1 and JNK2 regulate the phosphorylation state of microtubule-associated protein MAP1B, whose role in axonal regeneration was previously characterized. Moreover, lack of MAP1B prevents neurite retraction induced by JNK inhibition. Thus, signaling by individual JNKs is differentially implicated in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and neurite regeneration.\nAfter 6 months the work becomes available to the public to copy, distribute, or display under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

{"text":"Some sources cost less than others, so you should shop around to find the best deal.\nValentine's Day is one of the biggest gift-giving holidays of the year. In fact, consumers are expected to spend more than $130 on items for loved ones, according to the National Retail Federation's Valentine's Day spending survey. Among the most popular gifts (no surprise here) are flowers. One-third of those surveyed plan to give flowers, with spending expected to top $1.9 billion.\nAnyone who has ever bought a dozen red roses knows that they can be expensive. The average price on Valentine's Day is about $80. Now, you probably don't want to come off looking cheap on Valentine's Day, but there's no reason to spend more than you have to on flowers. Cheapism.com, a Web site that identifies the best cheap products, found that you can save significantly by ordering flowers from a local florist.\nA dozen red roses from a local florist cost about $50, compared with $59 to $86 from major online florists, according to Cheapism.com's research. To find a florist near you, visit the Society of American Florists' national florist directory or do a search on Yelp for florists with good reviews.\nOne thing the Cheapism.com research doesn't take into consideration is that you often can find coupon codes online to help lower the cost of ordering from online florists. For example, according to coupon site Offers.com, consumers can find discounts of up to 50% on roses and flowers from companies like FTD, ProFlowers and other popular flower delivery options. Also check Coupon Sherpa to find discounts for flowers.\n-- Order early and ask about specials.\n-- Pick up your flower order and deliver it yourself (to save on delivery costs).\n-- Consider flowers other than roses, such as an orchid, a bouquet of tulips or a basket with a bulb plant that can be planted in the spring.\n-- Sometimes less is more.

{"text":"The prevalent approach in Western countries towards health is generally based on symptom care rather than on health prevention and promotion.\nUsually we begin to deal with our health when there is something wrong with it, instead of taking care of it in advance, through conscious daily choices about food, movement, sleep, stress management, and so on: in short, our everyday lifestyle. Commonly we prioritise other duties and interests ahead of a focus on healthy lifestyle throughout our younger years and address health concerns when they arise later in life.\nThis kind of approach, focussing on symptoms, makes it necessary to look for immediate and fast solutions once the problem arises, without worrying about the reason for it, and without a more comprehensive view and a long-term management of the problem.\nJust to give you a couple of examples: keeping an incorrect posture at work, never exercising, or eating too many preserved and processed foods, can cause, among other things, headaches. BUT, instead of changing posture, starting to do some yoga classes, or eating more fresh and whole foods and avoiding bad wine, if I have a headache I will probably take a tablet to address it. Easy! Or, let\u2019s say I do not drink enough water, I smoke often and I do not eat enough healthy foods, so my skin is dry, opaque and wrinkled. Instead of drinking more, quitting smoking and eating more vegetables and nuts, I will probably buy an expensive face cream. Much easier!\nThis approach applies perfectly to weight management and diet as well, but with even more complex facets. The weight gain which leads to overweight and obesity, as well as other eating related issues, develop gradually over years through every daily lifestyle choice, every repeated unconscious behaviour we put in place, and many other factors we don\u2019t notice or overlook, which become consolidated habits, routines, needs and preferences, and which also bring slow and imperceptible changes in the body and the brain.\nBut at some point, after years of this lifestyle, we realize that we can no longer keep going that way, because the clothes are no longer fitting, we feel often tired and off, or we have constant issues like reflux or constipation, SO we immediately look for a fast solution, the panacea for all corporate ills, that can make everything disappear in a moment, no matter the process that has led to that condition over time. A magic pill, a magic diet, or the super-food of the week.\nThe point is that a strict diet certainly can make you lose a lot of weight in the short run, but it will bring more weight in the medium-long term because it will reduce variety, it will make you feel hungry and trigger your desire for \u2018prohibited\u2019 food. Adverts say super-foods are full of benefits, and this can be true, but no one alone is resolute or immediate if anything else changes. Only making gradual modifications in the wider overall picture of your practices will make you able to achieve and manage wellbeing without effort.\nFor instance, instead of cutting out all carbs or over-eating chia seeds, try to increase variety and include some healthy foods gradually in your meals every day, such as vegetables and whole grains; chose stairs instead of the elevator more often, or walk the dog a few times more over the week. At the same time, just begin to reduce counterproductive and harmful practices step by step, for instance putting two tea spoons of sugar in the coffee instead of three for two weeks until you are used to it, replace snacks and junk foods with fruits and nuts, reduce screen time, etc. In the medium term you will gradually and naturally start to feel the benefits of these small changes, and they will allow you to keep going on this track without a lot of effort. Your mood will change, and your energy will increase.\nLet\u2019s stop believing in magic, and take a more proactive approach. Our health is in our hands, much more than we realise! With what we have found so far about nutrition and mental health, we believe this is a particularly important approach for both your physical health and mental health.\nSara is a PhD candidate with the Food and Mood Centre and a qualified Health Psychologist and Nutritional Therapist.

{"text":"Why Strength Training? Why Bodymass Gym?\nDid you say yes to any of the three?\nIf you did, then you said yes to strength training. You said yes to lifting weight. You said yes to Bodymass Gym.\nIt\u2019s 2018 and slowly but surely, we\u2019re starting to see more people squatting, more people bench pressing, more people deadlifting, and most importantly, more people moving and feeling better.\nSo, let\u2019s look at why these people are \u201cdoing it right\u201d and why strength training is the most optimal approach to achieving the aforementioned goals.\nFirst of all, in my opinion, strength training is NOT synonymous with resistance training. The difference is very small, but yet so large. Once again, in my opinion, resistance training sounds like and implies a random assortment of exercises done to appease someone\u2019s orders. A doctor\u2019s order, a news article, or a commercial telling you that you should \u201cincorporate resistance training in your exercise regimen\u201d. What does that even mean\u2026?\nWhen I read, \u201cresistance training\u201d, I read bands, cables, and machines. I read a lack of supervision, a lack of coaching, and a lack of progress. I read a lack of direction. I read \u201cI\u2019m doing it just to do it\u201d.\nOn the other hand, in my opinion, strength training is the pursuit of gaining strength (obviously\u2026? goes without saying\u2026?), and implies progress. But most importantly, it implies using free weights (be it dumbbells or barbells) to improve functional movement. It implies proper coaching, proper form, and proper programming and exercise selection.\nWith Bodymass Build, you get just that: a strength training program that is specifically designed to improve functional movement patterns, to improve body composition, and to build self-confidence. It will challenge you, but it will also empower you.\nMore specifically, Bodymass Build is a strength training program that runs in four-week cycles, focuses on multi-joint, compound movements, and utilizes fundamental principles of progressive overload and periodization to produce optimal results. Each cycle provides a breath of fresh air and an opportunity to learn new movements, while maintaining the ultimate goal of full-body strength.\nThat said, with full-body strength as the goal, Bodymass Gym members can expect to build muscle and to burn fat as a byproduct. This is mainly due to two reasons: getting stronger will require building more muscle and getting stronger will require more work, work that will burn plenty of calories. And the best way to build muscle is to get stronger at using movements that utilize most the amounts of muscle: multi-joint, compound movements. And you guessed it\u2026 the best way to burn fat is to do movements that require the most amount of work: multi-joint, compound movements.\nThis, alone, is why strength training trumps yoga, spin, pilates, boot camp, HIIT, and the like. That is not to say these training methods (I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d really call them training methods, more so classes, but that\u2019s besides the point) do not hold merit, that they should not be done, or that they are not fun, but they just are not the most optimal options when building muscle and losing fat is the goal. They also do not provide the same level of incremental and \u201ctrackable\u201d progress that strength training provides, which makes it difficult to continue doing over a long period of time.\nUltimately, there is no magic bullet and there is no secret. Building muscle and losing fat, or getting \u201ctoned\u201d (because that is what getting toned means), is a byproduct of training properly and consistently over a long period of time. And our goal at Bodymass Gym is to provide you with the tools to do just that: train properly and consistently over a long period of time.\nMore often than not, many think that you need to do a lot of repetitions of an exercise or to spend hours upon hours in the gym in order to benefit or see results. At Bodymass Gym, we stress Quality over Quantity. Performing an excessive amount of repetitions or using a weight that does not suit you can increase the risk of injury due to form breakdown and overuse of the specific muscle group being used. There is a difference between doing as little as you can and doing as much as you need to. The minimum effective dose is all that you need to see results. For example, if you have an infection, and 100mg would help the infection, your doctor would not prescribe you 300mg of that medication.\nTotal Body, 2-3 Days per Week OR Two Days of Upper Body and Two Days of Lower Body: Your workout should consist of 8-10 exercises, with a repetition range of 6-10 reps, and complete at least 2-3 sets. Be sure to perform a total body warm-up that includes mobility work specific to the focus of the workout.\nAgonist & Antagonist Muscle Groups: Incorporate supersets to cut down your rest time between exercises. If you are performing a lower body exercise, pair it with an upper body exercise; or if you are performing a pushing movement, pair it with a pulling movement. For example, barbell bench press followed by a bent-over dumbbell row.\nContrast Training: Immediately follow a strength exercise with a power exercise of the same muscle group. For example, goblet squat followed by squat jumps.\nUnilateral and Bilateral Movements: Everyone has a stronger side. Incorporate the use of both dumbbells and barbell exercises. For example, barbell push press followed by a single arm lat pulldown.\nIn addition to the tips listed above, remember it\u2019s important to ensure that your training plan and strategy is aligned with your training goals, in terms of both quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Wednesday 1st of March was an important day at SPNL. SPNL team welcomed Aakoura mayor who showed interest in conserving its municipal land and developing sustainable development initiatives in collaboration with SPNL.\nLocated in the Jbeil District, on of Mount Lebanon Governorate (Mouhafaza), Aakoura is the jewel of Mount Lebanon known for ancient Maple trees and Juniper Forest, ecological and cultural assets. It represents approximately 1% of Land territory, a host of rich flora & fauna, especially for game birds such as Chukar Partridge, Wild Boar and Hare.\nThe municipal council was proactive in declaring the Aakoura municipal land as Hima for sustainable use such as ecotourism, responsible hunting, and responsible grazing.\nThe municipality of Aakoura signed the decision to adopt the new Hima annexed with a map that locate the Hima.\nAmong its major monuments beside the 42 churches, are St Peter\u2019s and Paul\u2019s Church, carved in the rock, the abundant springs: Ruwais spring and grotto considered one of the biggest in Lebanon, the village spring, and the Monk\u2019s spring, Saydet El Habes an old convent that was a residence for many bishops and many other things to see.\nThe Hima represents a destination for hunters from all regions of Lebanon. Therefore, it is the aim to put together with the municipality, Paul Ariss (private sector interested to establish RHA in Aakoura), and Middle East Center for Responsible Hunting-MECRH, a business and management plan in order to promote responsible hunting practices, encourage wildlife conservation, and ecotourism.\nThis is part of SPNL RHU efforts established during the Birdfair project in collaboration with BirdLife International, in order to stop illegal killing of birds and promote responsible hunting practices within responsible hunting areas-RHAs in collaboration with municipalities & private sector as the best approach to support hunting law enforcement in Lebanon.\nThe revival of the Hima system is empowering communities to take responsibility for managing local resources. This approach is being championed by the Society for Protection of Nature in Lebanon (BirdLife in Lebanon) and is helping to build capacity for local economic enterprises, linked to the wildlife and landscape conservation."}

{"text":"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico: A failing dam prompted emergency evacuations of two towns in northwest Puerto Rico on Friday as the U.S. territory struggled with flooding, an island-wide power blackout and other dangers in Hurricane Maria's wake.\nThe National Weather Service in San Juan said Friday that the northwestern municipalities of Isabela and Quebradillas, home to some 70,000 people, were being evacuated with buses because the nearby Guajataca Dam was failing. Details remained sketchy about the evacuation with communications hampered after the storm. The 345-yard (316-meter) dam holds back a manmade lake covering about 2 square miles and was built decades ago, U.S. government records show.\nAll across the battered island, residents feared power could be out for weeks - or even months - and wondered how they would cope. Some of the island's 3.4 million residents planned to head to the U.S. to temporarily escape the desolation. At least in the short term, though, the soggy misery will continue: additional rain - up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) - is expected through Saturday.\nIn San juan, Neida Febus wandered around her neighborhood with bowls of cooked rice, ground meat and avocado, offering food to anyone in need. The damage was so extensive, the 64-year-old retiree said, that she didn't think the power would be turned back on until Christmas.\nThe death toll in Puerto Rico stood at six but was likely to rise. At least 27 lives have been lost around the Caribbean, including at least 15 people killed on hard-hit Dominica. Other islands reporting deaths were Haiti with three; Guadeloupe, two; and Dominican Republic, one.\nBy Friday afternoon, Maria was passing northeast of the Turks and Caicos with winds of 125 mph (205 kph). A hurricane warning remained in effect for those islands as well as the southeastern Bahamas. The storm is not expected to pose a threat to the U.S. mainland.\nMeanwhile, the loss of power left residents hunting for gas canisters for cooking, collecting rainwater or steeling themselves mentally for the hardships to come in the tropical heat.\nIn Puerto Rico, the electric grid was in sorry shape long before Maria - and Hurricane Irma two weeks ago - struck.\nDiana Jaquez, one of the owners of the Coquette hair salon in the Santurce area, assessed damage from the storm with her husband Friday as their children played nearby. She said she hadn't decided whether to leave the island.\n\"Business has dropped a lot,\" she said. \"People have other priorities than looking good.\"\nRossello said his administration was trying to open ports soon to receive food, water, generators, cots and other supplies.\n\"We're used to the lights going out because of storms here in Puerto Rico, but this time, we're worried,\" he said."}
{"text":"Well, try as we all might, we just can't shake Brett Favre. First, it's \"Streak over!\" Now, it's \"Will he play this week?\"\nLike everything else Favre-related, I see it in fairly simple terms: If he is pushing to play out of ego-gratification, it's a mistake. If he is actually healthy enough to play -- and not just play, but play better than the next-best alternative, Tavaris Jackson -- then he should play.\nCFB: Will Muschamp intro'ed as Florida head coach. He is dynamic. He is no-nonsense. And he is going to run a pro-style offense, rather than the spread. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I appreciate that Alabama's pro-style -- which Muschamp is obviously modeling -- was fairly effective, particularly against Florida. But I still think that the evolution of strategy favors the spread as a clearly optimized offense (see Oregon, Auburn).\nOregon uniforms for the BCS title game: The Ducks get a lot of grief for having more costume changes than Lady Gaga -- and garish combos to match. But I kind of love that they do it; it is unique in college football, and in a way, the equivalent of Facebook to, say, Penn State's Saturday Evening Post. I am a sucker for highlighter green, btw.\nI also love the highlighter yellow. Good stuff.\nSpread vs. Pro-style: Interesting debate. QBs from Spread-style O's generally dont fare well in the NFL. So your recruiting strategy is either: 1) Play in an offense where you'll be the great in college. OR 2) Play in an offense where you'll succeed int he NFL.\nCollege Bowl Pick 'Em Contest!"}

{"text":"Mentone Girls' Grammar has earned a world-class reputation as an outstanding school and a market leader in girls\u2019 education. We have had the traditions and track-record of success since 1899 and we continue to be progressive, outward-looking and contemporary in our thinking, shaping Australian education into what schools should be - communities where education empowers, where there is a culture of care, and where the future can be shaped to make a better world.\nOur mission drives us to create a very special community, one which is authentic and \u2018down to earth\u2019 and which harnesses the best teachers, motivated parents, business and community leaders, global education partners and researchers, and a vast network of alumnae from around the world to engage in important work \u2013 growing \u2018remarkable women\u2019. Together, we empower girls to aspire to excellence, to make a difference and, as enterprising global citizens, to rise boldly to the opportunities of their times. We are not afraid to try creative new approaches which respond to our students\u2019 changing needs \u2013 from our ground-breaking Enterprise Academy which links students\u2019 learning to the world of future work and entrepreneurship, to impactful wellbeing approaches that get to the heart of how girls think and process emotions - we constantly craft environments where girls can learn, have fun and flourish, right from the earliest days of their education.\nOur students enjoy our beautiful single campus, small class sizes, vibrant learning, individual care and attention, an impressive array of co-curricular activities and all the advantages of a seamless, technology-rich education from Kindergarten to Year 12.\nImportantly, we take the time to get to know our students. We listen to their concerns, understand their fears, and expose them to a whole range of surprising opportunities about what girls and women can be. Through the right blend of challenge and choice, formal and informal learning experiences in Australia and around the world, and great female and male role-models, we build their self-confidence and encourage them to discover themselves through all the exciting programs and initiatives that the School has to offer.\nAnd we do that expertly for girls, from their academic success to the factors that impact on their own wellbeing.\nYear after year, our students exceed expectations, surpassing their personal goals and achieving outstanding academic results. This is impressive given that we are \u2018open-entry\u2019, accepting girls of all talents and abilities, with different temperaments and interests, and from diverse faiths and cultures.\nBut excellent academic results are only one part of the story. Our enviable location by the beach provides a fresh and healthy educational environment and has inspired our powerful WAVES priorities which influence all aspects of our work. These priorities help our students believe in themselves as confident, capable and ethical young women who can enjoy learning, make a difference, and ride the waves of the world beyond school.\nThe world needs women who can ride these waves; women who have a global perspective, who appreciate diversity, who are open, inclusive, and sensitive to all people; women who know how to get things done while navigating the dramatic societal and economic changes before us. This world of artificial intelligence, globalisation and flexible work requires that women have the skills, capabilities and mindset to see possibilities, seize opportunities and to make a difference, so that they can create value for themselves and for others; a world where women have a strong voice and can take their place alongside men to collaborate for a better world.\nThere is considerable research evidence to show that girls benefit from a quality all girls' environment. Stereotyping of subjects and careers is limited in girls' only schools, so girls can feel confident there are no impediments to their choices, whether they are in academia, sport, music, entrepreneurship or many other co-curricular areas. This also extends to their choices of career paths. All activities are open to girls: they are the ones who participate, influence and lead for genuine achievement. They learn to respectfully question society\u2019s preconceptions about what girls and women can do and hold to account those who would hold them back from becoming \u2018remarkable women\u2019.\nI am proud that parents feel confident in entrusting their daughters to us as part of a very special community, one where current and future students can\u2019t wait to come to school and where staff are proud to contribute. As Principal and CEO (Chief Encouragement Officer), I encourage you to come and visit us and to see for yourself how Mentone Girls\u2019 Grammar could partner with you for your daughter\u2019s remarkable education."}
{"text":"I\u2019ll never forget the moment I met Harold Ramis. It was on the set of Analyze This. We had just wrapped for the day, a summer storm had sprouted up from out of nowhere and most of the crew was trapped on the front porch of the house where we we had been shooting. I looked over and there he was, my hero, in the flesh, right next to me. I imagine I must have grinned one of my giant grins (because I was just so geeky happy to be on his set) and he took one look at me, shook his head and just started to laugh.\nI\u2019ll never know what he was laughing at, it could have been my t-shirt (which had a stick figure drawing on it of a girl offering up her heart on a stick for all the world to grab \u2013 which if you know me is apropos) but in that moment it felt like he was laughing because he saw me in a way that few people ever see me. It felt like he looked straight into my soul, saw right past my exterior to the total dork that resides within and immediately had a good private chuckle over it.\nFrom that moment on I was blessed to form a kinship with him. He let me sit beside him and learn while he was directing, and even let me tag along on his big family\/crew dinners that he loved to have after a long day on the set. It was one of the most magical times of my life and I had to pinch myself regularly. I couldn\u2019t believe this was really happening.\nI knew before I had even met him that I loved and admired Harold Ramis (after all he was the man who had had his hands on just about every piece of comedy that had ever been important to me, and comedy was VERY important to me) but it wasn\u2019t until I witnessed him running his big Hollywood set with a quiet Buddha-like confidence, until I witnessed the special bond he and his wife Erica had and the way they talked about their kids, until he shared with me some of his disappointments and until I had shared a good insider giggle with him over the irony of him receiving letters from spiritual leaders of just about every major religion telling him Groundhog Day was the perfect demonstration of their particular faith, that it hit me; I realized that this man was so much more than one of the great comedy writer\/directors of our time, he was actually a very special spirit on this planet, flying intentionally under the radar, who possessed enough intelligence, wisdom and kindness that he could have made a difference in this world through any path he might have chosen, but that he chose comedy. We comedy lovers didn\u2019t choose him. He chose us.\nAfter that experience I started writing like crazy. I wanted to use comedy the way I suspected he used comedy: to enlighten, to show us ourselves. And for all of the years since, I have had one private goal in mind: to write a comedy so good that it would get the Harold stamp of approval and that he might grace me with his Directorial presence. I wanted that chance to work with him again, even if it was just one more time.\nOver the years I sent him scripts and, like the generous man he was, he always responded back, telling me exactly what I needed to hear (not necessarily what I wanted to hear) and with every bit of feedback it made me stronger and more committed.\nEven last year when I naively offered him the opportunity to play the part of a ghost (gasp! I had no idea he was sick) he still took the time to make sure his person got back to me. It was a no for the ghost, but I wasn\u2019t giving up. I was still firmly committed to creating something that would entice him, and then yesterday happened.\nFor a moment there I felt like my dream had just died right along with him. I was inconsolable. But luckily that didn\u2019t last long. How can you be so sad about someone who was made you so happy? And how can you honor the man who has inspired you so much in any other way than by keeping on keeping on? And so, begrudgingly, I will just have to let the dream grow and change shape.\nHe really did call me a pure soul a couple of years back. I don\u2019t think he meant it as a compliment. I think it was a concern. I think he actually did have that ability to see straight through me and he was worried that I was too tender hearted to make it in Hollywood without getting eaten by the wolves (and I probably was, who am I kidding) but I wish I would have gotten the chance to tell him that, although it took me awhile, thanks to him I finally did get it. I finally figured out how to protect myself in this world, without hardening my heart. The answer was with me all along: Comedy.\nYou are and always will be my hero in every sense of the word. Thank you for making the world a funnier place."}
{"text":"As court weighs efficacy of antitrust settlement, Microsoft is trumpeting its compliance efforts.\nA federal court is still weighing the efficacy of a proposed antitrust settlement signed between Microsoft Corp. and the Department of Justice in November, but the Redmond, Wash., software maker nonetheless must meet several deadlines under the deal this month. As the same court considers whether stricter antitrust penalties are necessary, Microsoft is trumpeting the steps it is already taking to remedy its illegal conduct.\nThe settlement inked with the Justice Department and nine states is considerably more lenient than an alternative remedy proposal sought by nine other states. Both proposals address the need for Microsoft to disclose more technical information, give developers a way to remove access to the companys middleware and provide greater flexibility to OEMs, but the proposals differ dramatically in the degree to which Microsoft must pursue those goals.\nTomorrow, under the terms of the settlement proposal, Microsoft will launch a program to license 113 communications protocols for other vendors to use to interoperate with Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP and future versions of Windows. The licensing program, which the company described as novel, is based on 12 tasks that reflect how Microsofts server operating systems interoperate with desktop operating systems.\nWhile the alternative remedy proposal sought by the non-settling states requires Microsoft to share technical information more broadly, the Justice Department settlement permits Microsoft to charge royalties and reasonable licensing fees -- which the company is not listing publicly -- for the protocols.\n\"Theres very substantial IP and valuable technology in these protocols,\" Brad Smith, senior vice president of law and corporate affairs, said in a conference call with reporters this morning. \"The prices for the protocols are very small relative to the price of the products.\"\nBeginning Aug. 28, Microsoft will also make available for free 272 internal application programming interfaces for five middleware features defined in the proposed settlement: Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player, Windows Messenger, Outlook Express and the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine. The stricter remedy proposal sought by the states more broadly defines the scope of middleware subject to the anti-trust penalties."}
{"text":"Over the week-end of the 6\/7 September 2008 heavy rainfall in the Romsley area, to the south west of Birmingham resulted in over topping and partial failure of the embankment retaining the Mill Pond at Shutmill Cottage. This was the second significant over topping and failure of the embankment in a period of less than 10 years.\nThe resultant surge of storm water resulted in significant damage to Shut Mill Cottage and necessitated the occupants being rescued by the Fire Brigade. The flood waters then progressed downstream and caused significant damage in the village Belbroughton, approximately two miles down stream.\nFollowing discussions with the building insurers of Shutmill Cottage, the Environment Agency and the Local Authority, it was agreed that the remedial works at Shutmill would be designed as if the Mill Pond was covered by the Reservoirs Act, even though the body of water only had an approximate volume of 2,500m3. This was agreed so as to provide additional protection to both the home owner and the properties downstream in the village of Belbroughton.\nThis necessitated a re-design of the outfall structure, together with the strengthening and raising the level of the embankment to meet the requirements for a reservoir.\nDue to the sensitive environmental location, wide ranging ecological and flood risk studies were undertaken before the construction of a scale model of the outfall structure was constructed to verify the design assumptions.\nThe construction phase of the project was made more challenging by the extremely restricted access to the site with many deliveries to the site having to be double-handled in an adjacent field to allow restricted access plant to take the material to the work site.\nWorks were also hampered by a neighbour dispute regarding shared access which meant significant parts of the work had to be discussed and agreed with Solicitors before work could progress.\nThe ultimate design solution of new reinforced concrete outfall structure and sheet piling to enhance the embankment has been softened by the careful addition of brick facing to match the original cottage and Mill Pond features with soft landscaping to reflect the original cottage garden and rural surroundings.\nAs part of the general refurbishment of the cottage itself, required as a result of the inundation, the owner has taken the opportunity to not only improve the thermal insulation of the building but has installed air source heating and the option to have hydro electric generation through the outfall structure in the future.\nThe overall result of this project is not only a vastly improved structure with a benefit to the owner of the Shut Mill Cottage but it has provided protection to the many buildings and owners downstream in the village of Belbroughton."}

{"text":"In the familiar passage above, the people of God are commanded to simply \u201cbe still\u201d and know that Jehovah God is the one true God. The Hebrew term for \u201cbe still\u201d is \u201craphah.\u201d It means to \u201cstop working\u201d or to \u201clet drop.\u201d Usually it carried a negative meaning. For instance, if a laborer had become slack in his duties and had dropped the ball on his daily tasks, that person was described as being \u201craphah.\u201d But interestingly, in this particular passage of Scripture the term is used in a positive manner. Here we see that God\u2019s people are commanded to \u201cbe still.\u201d It means that for us to truly know God, we must cease toiling and striving and simply let go; we must let go of our own efforts and let go of our own strength. Then and only then will we be able to truly know and see the greatness of God.\nI remember one time when the zipper on my son\u2019s jacket was off track and stuck. Like a typical little boy, he squirmed and grunted as he yanked and pulled on the zipper in a feverish attempt to get it unstuck. Yet the zipper would not budge. For a while I did nothing as I watched his frustration mount. Finally I looked at him out of love and told him to stop. But he only continued to hold on tightly to the zipper. The more he pulled, the more he seemed to make matters worse. So I reached down and told him to let go, be still, and let me do it. He finally let loose and I was able to loosen the zipper.\nAnd so it is with the difficulties of life. It is easy for us to hit a snag and get off track. And in our own feverish attempt, we try to fix the problem but only end up making things worse. We hold on to our problem thinking that we can fix it on our own, when all we really need to do is simply be still, let go of our problem, and let our Heavenly Father reach down and take hold of it. We must remember that our heavenly Father is always eager to fix our snags and help us get our life back on track. And He is the only one that can loosen our tangled life. Bottom line; we must be still, cease striving, and rest in simply knowing that He is God. \u201cLetting go and letting God\u201d might sound like a catchy clich\u00e9, but it is most certainly true.\nOne of my favorite daily devotionals is Lettie Burd Cowman\u2019s \u201cStreams in the Desert.\u201d In describing the beauty of being still before God, she says a \u201clake must be calm if the heavens are to be reflected on its surface.\u201d And so it is with the Christian life. The only way that we can truly know the Lord and reflect His presence in our life is to simply be still before Him.\nBut the question remains, how can one \u201cbe still\u201d before God while riding the wheel of the world with all the life\u2019s spokes circling around us? Once again Cowman\u2019s \u201cStreams in the Desert\u201d sheds light on how this is possible; for \u201cthere is in the swiftest wheel that revolves upon its axis a place in the very center where there is no movement at all \u2013 And so in the busiest life there may be a place where we dwell alone with God in eternal stillness.\u201d Yet this does not mean that to \u201cbe still\u201d is to be stagnant. We must remember that at the parting of the Red Sea, God told to the Israelites to \u201cstand still and see the salvation of the Lord\u201d followed by a clear command to \u201cgo forward\u201d (Exodus 14:13-15).\nPonder these things today and ask God to grant you stillness before Him. Oh that we as the children of God would cease striving and simply be still before our kind and loving Father!\nWe should always have faith in ourselves, but we should put our faith in God among all else. We should not worry and try to take over our own destiny. Even though we may struggle with hardships in our lives we experience them for certain reasons that we cannot understand at the time we go through them. God knows what we need and when we need and always answers prayers, so we should put our complete faith in him even when it\u2019s hard to understand or accept. Even when we find it difficult to trust in Him, we must step out in faith."}
{"text":"Legislation: Marijuana is illegal in Slovakia and you coul get yourself in jail for 3-5 years for carrying POT.\nLaw Enforcement: Its OK to smoke in parks , but look out for police\u2026 they won\u2019t tolerate any marijuana .. if you have luck you can bribe them (at least 200USD).\nBrands: Skunk , White Widow , Jack Herrer , quality of weed is variable.. if you have good connections you can get unbelievable weed .. 1 hit from a bong and you cant move ;-).\nLegislation: Marijuana is currently illegal in Slovakia, and so is any related activity. However, there are upcoming sounds of medical use legalization.\nLaw Enforcement: Marijuana import, export or possession are prohibited. However, it has been reported that the police is sometimes forgiving towards drug law offenders.\nBuy Marijuana in Bratislava: The safest bet would be to sit in one of the city\u2019s trendy caf\u00e9\u2019s and ask young people at nearby tables.\nBrands: Usually home-grown local weed is sold. The local weed is in varying quality.\nWhile there is a lot of home-grown bud floating around the city \u2014 usually of varying quality \u2014 the stiff penalties and low tolerance for drug use are a good excuse to stick to the excellent beers and occasional shot of honey liquor.\nSeparated from the Czech Republic in 1993, Slovakia failed to make the economic success out of the break-up of Czechoslovakia their neighbours did. And without the same level of stunning cultural and architectural excess, tourism \u2014 and tolerance for Western drug use \u2014 has remained low. But that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a good time to be had in beautiful downtown Bratislava.\nThe city has an abundance of outdoor cafes, lining the streets of the city\u2019s Old Town. While there are a few overpriced dives, you can usually play it safe by heading to wherever the tables are fairly full.\nArchways, cobblestones and detailed architectural designs add to the European ambiance that had drawn moviemakers to film Kull the Conqueror, Dragonheart and The Peacemaker in the city.\nInteresting modern art installments \u2014 including a laser beam that lances through a glass tube before reflecting down the adjoining street with the aid of mirrors. A mirrored ball splits the beam over a few of the cafes.\nGolden Pheasant \u2013a pilsner \u2014 and Corgon \u2014 a lager\u2013 are the two beers most commonly found on tap, with Corgon holding out in local hangouts and Pheasant in touristy watering holes.\nHoney wine, a mildly sweet drink with a fairly low alcohol content, is rarely available in bars. But keep an eye out for bottles sold at stands and stores around the shopping district.\nDomestic hard liquors are definitely worth taking a sip of too. Again showing the country\u2019s ties with the Czech Republic to the west, plum brandy known as slivonice is wildly popular. Often aged in oak barrels for three years, take a careful look at what your being served since cheap slivonice bears an unpleasant resemblance to rubbing alcohol. A drink unique to the region is borovicka, a juniper brandy reminiscent of dry gin.\nDespite the strict laws and fairly conservative society that frowns on anything but alcohol-related inebriation, there is weed to be found in Bratislava.\nAlmost all of the pot is home-grown either in backyards, at country houses or in small indoor plots. Your best way to get a good toke is to find a pub filled with young Slovaks, sit down and strike up a conversation. The people are extremely friendly, especially compared to Czechs.\nOther places to buy include street vendors selling paraphernalia in between the cafes in the downtown shopping district.\nIf you are buying, expect to pay about $15 USD per gram for pot of moderate to low quality. Hash may be available, but is expensive and very difficult to find.\nPart of the reason weed and hash are harder to get in Bratislava is the strength of the local drug laws. Unlike neighbouring countries and the European Union \u2014 where possession for personal use is permitted \u2014 there is an absolute ban on carrying, using or selling any drug in Slovakia, according to the Ministry of the Interior.\n\u201cIt a criminal offence to unlawfully possess narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances\u2026for one\u2019s own use,\u201d a Ministry of the Interior representative said.\nSlovak police are permitted to force someone to be tested for drug use if they are arrested for any reason, and punishments range from expensive fines to jail time and expulsion from the country.\nIf you are carrying enough to be considered a dealer \u2014 an amount not defined by law \u2014 jail sentences of 15 to 20 years loom on the horizon.\nWith Draconian drug laws unlikely to be reformed until the Slovak Republic enters the European Union in 2005 (at the earliest), this picturesque Central European town may be best enjoyed through the fog of booze instead of pot smoke."}
{"text":"This Halloween I enjoyed a delightful afternoon tea at the Corinthia Hotel in London. This 5 star hotel opened in April 2011 and is the latest addition to the city. The luxurious hotel prides itself on high standards, opulence, comfort and exceptional modern decor, that is chic and exclusive. Whilst also boasting some of the largest bedrooms and suites in London that offer outstanding views of the River Thames, the London Eye and Trafalgar Square.\nAfternoon tea is held in the elegant lobby lounge, situated within the heart of the hotel. This intimate space is set a few steps up from the reception area, illuminated by a spectacular Baccarat chandelier, a mesmerising main feature to the room. In the middle of the lounge a large mirrored table reflects gorgeous little orchid arrangements, and to the side of the room an offering of cakes under glass domes.\nWe were seated at a pretty table, underneath the stunning crystal chandelier, that was beautifully laid out with crisp white table linen. Welcomed by our waitress we were then presented with the menu. I could not wait to see what the Halloween offerings would be.\nWe were offered options of either the traditional afternoon tea or the special Halloween tea, which can be enjoyed with or without a glass of Laurent-Perrier champagne. The allure of the treats on offer for the Halloween tea where too enticing to resist. The hotel also offers an option for a more subtle cream tea that is a selection of pastries and tea that you can choose individually from the menu. So, even if you don't want to indulge in the full tea you can still come and have a good time.\nOnce we had made our selection some delicious finger sandwiches where promptly brought to our table with gourmet fillings such as Loch Var smoked salmon, creamed Innes goats cheese with cucumber and organic egg mayonnaise all topped off with a decorative sprinkling of micro watercress.\nNext we moved on to the scones, delivered on an ornate three tier floor standing cake stand, with the top and middle tier proudly displaying the impeccable Halloween inspired delights with the bottom tier containing plain and raisin scones. A special mention must go to the scones as they where an absolute delight, so fluffy and heavenly, if your looking for the perfect scone look no further. Accompanied with clotted cream and raspberry and strawberry jam they really are worth a visit for.\nBut the highlight just had to be the pastries so charming and pretty, and the taste was just as incredible. Honestly, this was the best tasting selection of pastries I have had at an afternoon tea in London. I was so impressed with the attention to detail and the utterly delicious taste of the cakes. My favourite's were the Witch\u2019s Hat, made from a delectable raspberry macaroon, topped and filled with fresh raspberries and cream, and the Broomstick, which was a delicious blackcurrant mousse with black ink jelly and topped off with whimsical spun sugar, that added a fantastical touch.\nThe tea menu is extensive and combines a perfect combination of rare and traditional teas. 'Afternoon at The Palace' is their signature blend of single Darjeeling and China black teas, for a refined and aromatic taste. A perfect accompaniment to sweet afternoon treats. I opted for my favourite Madagascan Vanilla which is a blend of Ceylon and China black teas enriched with real pieces of Bourbon Vanilla from Madagascar. It has a delicious natural sweetness and a great vanilla taste.\nI cannot recommend the afternoon tea at the Corinthia enough. With a superb central London location and fresh and dreamy decor the lobby lounge is the perfect place to spend an afternoon indulging in divine treats whist relaxing with a cup of tea. The service was great, perfectly attentive without being too pushy. The whole experience was one you must treat yourself too.\nBest Hotels in Darjeelingthank you..!\nHotels often provide a number of additional services for tourist. Here I get very useful details about luxury hotels available which offer great leaving facilities and food services with affordable price."}

{"text":"A few weeks ago, my favorite Internet writer, Mark Evanier, launched a series of articles teaching aspiring writers how to cope with rejection. If you\u2019re not familiar with Evanier, in addition to his popular blog, he\u2019s been a successful TV, film and comic book writer for his entire career. So, he knows of what he writes when it comes to rejection. He\u2019s faced and overcome a lot of it.\nA career is something that fits into this sentence: \u201cWhen I grow up, I want to be a ____.\u201d A job is what you do to pay rent and buy groceries if and when you aren\u2019t able to become whatever noun you ever seriously put into that sentence.\nIt\u2019s entirely possibly to find one\u2019s career while working through jobs.\nLike Mark, I had dreams of growing up and becoming a writer and a filmmaker; and for many years I primarily made my living through writing. It wasn\u2019t writing in the way I had always imagined I would be doing, but it was writing and I considered myself mostly as a writer, whether it was professionally for other websites that paid me a salary or if it was for fun on my own movie news and review website.\nBut, considering myself as a writer and thinking to myself that that was my \u201ccareer,\u201d I missed a large part of what was actually my true \u201ccareer.\u201d The only thing, though, is that my own personal career definition isn\u2019t super well-defined. However, I am what I am.\nAnd, what I am is an Internet guy.\nThe Internet didn\u2019t really exist in the way that we know it exists until I embarked on my professional career. My first \u201cjob\u201d was in the print industry; which I took while patiently also working away on what I thought I wanted my career to be: A professional movie screenwriter. But, it was also at that time that a friend got me involved in writing for his website, which I considered a hobby between the day job and the aspiring screenwriting.\nHowever, after the print magazine went away and put me out of work, I got my first professional Internet job for a TV listings website and I struck out on my own at creating my own website, again, thinking it was just a hobby.\nSince those days \u2014 we\u2019re talking the early Aughts \u2014 up until now all of my professional jobs have been for Internet websites, most of which I thought of myself as primarily a writer for them, even though my \u201cjobs\u201d entailed all sorts of different things, including basic coding and asset management.\nAlso, over the years, while working on my own websites, I accumulated more and better coding skills: HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery, all because I felt a drive to present my writing in the best possible way online. However, because I acquired all these skills on my own projects, that I now take on freelance work building and modifying websites for clients.\nWhile I still enjoy writing \u2014 in fact, I\u2019m writing this on a break from coding websites for clients \u2014 it\u2019s not how I see my professional life anymore. Currently, my career has landed me as the team leader of an asset management team for the marketing department of a major entertainment company, I don\u2019t do any creative writing at all. And I couldn\u2019t be happier!\nTurns out that asset management speaks directly to my strong organization skills and my super-laser-focused attention to detail. It\u2019s a field full of strong challenges that I find extremely stimulating.\nAnd writing code for websites? That\u2019s not a career I could have ever dreamed up for myself as a kid, like the way today\u2019s kids can and do. Who knew I would take to that so strongly? I never did.\nSo, here I am. I\u2019ve had a pretty good career as an Internet guy. And the best part?\nI still gotta lot of days ahead of me."}
{"text":"At the recent SAP for Utilities event in Huntington Beach, SAP\u2019s Stefan Wolf gave a presentation about SAP\u2019s HANA in-memory database. I caught up with Stefan afterwards and talked to him about some of the ways HANA can be used by utility companies.\nTom Raftery: Hey everyone! We\u2019re here at the SAP for Utilities event and I have with me Stefan Wolf from SAP. Stefan you gave a talk yesterday, where you were talking about the use of HANA for utilities. Can you give me a little synopsis of that talk?\nStefan Wolf: Absolutely!. Thank you Tom for giving me this opportunity. I think utilities these days are challenged by a lot of different requirements. There is lots of data coming through new channels like smart metering, smart grid, social networks. It\u2019s pressure from the regulators, pressure from the public to get more information in real time, whether it\u2019s a storm situation or just about my current bill, it\u2019s mounting.\nSo they need the possibility to answer these in real time and manage the data and we have customers who are actually doing this today, with SAP tools. For example, one utility is using an SAP HANA solution to improve business process for energy settlement and they have achieved an improvement of a hundred times faster by moving certain steps of that process outside to a HANA box including the replication of the data.\nSo by just using HANA, they are now able to manage even when all their customers have smart meters and still running to a settlement process in the allowable timeframe. Other customers, for example have used HANA to optimize a collection process, by building a data mod in HANA to collect the information about the customers, the financial information, the surrounding information about the customers to now be much more, on time and on top of the information, and do the correction way more efficiently than before with manual error prone process.\nTom Raftery: Is there any customer facing technology using HANA?\nStefan Wolf: Yeah absolutely, so one example is a utility is using HANA to support their online portal, basically allow the customers to do bill simulations, and they draw their smart meter data from the back end system, from the legacy system into HANA and then run into HANA say, as a billing algorithm and within less than 4 seconds of overall process of getting the data and billing the data the customer sees a stimulated bill on the online portal. So it\u2019s literally in real time.\nTom Raftery: Stefan I\u2019ve heard that, there are data compression technologies in HANA as well, which reduce the size of the database how does this work?\nStefan Wolf: Absolutely, so we have one example, where a customer was using their business warehouse as a test case basically for moving into HANA and it had over 20 terabytes of data in their actual business warehouse and they moved it into HANA and it ended up with less than 700 GB. That was possible but not needing quite a bit of the data which business warehouse typically needs because of the time it takes to load the data from the source system, or they\u2019ve staging areas and so forth. And you have the segregation areas in business warehouse because it takes times to build those cubes. All of that is not necessary in HANA.\nSo you start with much less data to begin with and then in addition you have the compression factor HANA allows was which is typically between 4.0 and 5.0 to 1, so that reduced it so significantly from over 20 TB down to 700 GB.\nTom Raftery: So of course that makes it even faster again to analyze the data.\nStefan Wolf: Exactly, so now we have less data to store which you can analyze faster and you have an in memory which again improved the time. So between our previous in memory technology, business warehouse accelerator, which was although based on in-memory, but specifically only for BW available. And now HANA, we see even there an improvement of over five times of the reporting time and we see even 50 \u2014 effect of 50 increase of the performance compared to conventional business warehouse means.\nTom Raftery: Well, impressive. Stephan, that\u2019s been great. Thanks very much."}
{"text":"Discover how this photographer booked 60% more clients with Facebook video ads.\nKristina Houser is a wedding and portrait photographer and owner of Kristina Houser Photography & Cinema in Tampa Bay. Her studio was attracting a handful of new customers through local Google searches, but most of her business came from referrals. She wanted to expand her reach to bring in more business.\nKristina decided to experiment with Facebook advertising and, having heard that Facebook favors video in the News Feed, decided to experiment with video as well. The plan was to focus on promoting headshot sessions because of the low entry cost. Clients that come in at a lower price point often return to book shoots with family or come to her for wedding photos. Using Animoto, Kristina\u2019s team was able to create this video quickly and easily.\nThe video pairs some of their strongest headshot photographs with big, bold, eye-catching text that highlights the benefits of booking a shoot. \"We wanted something that felt professional and on-brand, so it was great that we were able to use our own colors for the text to tie it back to the studio,\" says Kristina. \"The collage blocks also made it easy for us to show off a lot of our work at once without the video getting too long.\"\nOnce the video was created, it was shared on the company's Facebook page and promoted for $100 using Facebook Ads Manager.\n\"I have started making more videos with Animoto and I am in love! The ease of making them is incredible and I can't wait to make marketing videos for all genres that we shoot.\"\nThe studio books 10 headshots in an average month. The month the Facebook video ad ran, they booked 16. Seven can be attributed to the Facebook video. A clear call to action at the end of the video made it easy for prospects to figure out how to get in touch, via phone or email, and where to go for more information.\nBookings aside, the video also led to a great deal of brand awareness. On the day the ad ran, the Kristina Houser Photography & Cinema website saw 415 visitors. That's more than 27X the average daily visitor count of 15.\nKristina also heard great feedback from friends and existing clients that saw the video. \"It was exciting to hear comments about how professional the video was,\" says Kristina. \"I didn't tell them it only took me 20 minutes.\"\nFind out how Kelly Brown uses video to reach a larger audience through social media.\nFind out how Vanessa Joy uses video slideshows to maximize her wedding photography sales.\nSee how Sue Bryce uses Animoto to easily create share-worthy social videos."}
{"text":"Over the past few years, I have heard so many remarkable stories from children's authors and illustrators. The stories are told with great enthusiasm and respect for their profession. I love hearing stories about how a love of books and art blossomed into a career or how a tiny idea developed into a book that I love. It is hard for me to walk away from a book-related event where I have had the opportunity to hear an author or illustrator speak and not be inspired to create something myself; a story of my own, a craft with my children, a new birthday blog post.\nI have attended many events alone, which I love, but I have found that I equally enjoy attending these events with my family. Amazingly, whether the event is big or small, or the author or illustrator is a national best seller or local sensation, we have always had a positive experience!\nThe line for Mark Teague was unusually long for the last signing of the day on this Sunday evening, but hundreds of people stood patiently with their Dinosaur and LaRue books for a chance to meet this inspiring author-illustrator.\nMy son had Mark Teague sign Pancakes for Supper! by Anne Isaacs. My youngest daughter had Baby Tamer, my youngest son had How Do Dinosaurs Get Well Soon? by Jane Yolen, my oldest daughter had Pigsty signed.\nEarlier that day, before Mark Teague's book signing, we took a break from the other book signings to listen to Mark Teague's talk about how much he loves his job as a children's book author and illustrator. Teague has illustrated over 40 children's books including the Poppleton series written by Cynthia Rylant and the How Do Dinosaurs series written by Jane Yolen.\nMark Teague read the latest Dinosaur book, How Do Dinosaurs Say I'm Mad?.\nHe also showed us how to draw a dinosaur. I was amazed to learn that Mark Teague had no formal art training. He is self-taught! According to Children's Corner, after graduating with a degree in history he went to visit his brother in New York City. The sketchbook he filled on the trip helped him land a job working at Barnes and Noble making window displays. The connections he made on job and being around inspiring children's books each day helped him publish his first book, The Trouble with the Johnsons in 1989.\n\"I was that kid in the back of classroom always scribbling pictures all over everything. I even got in trouble with my teachers instead of doing the math test I would be drawing pictures on the desk. I got in trouble one time with my mom because she bought me a new pair of sneakers, these beautiful white canvas sneakers. And by the time I got home from school that day, they had been covered with little ink drawings all over. My mother didn't always appreciate my artistic talents.\" (Mark Teague, National Book Festival 2013, Library of Congress).\nAt the moment of hearing this story from Mark Teague I was inspired by the idea of creating art on pair of white canvas sneakers. I have my own memories of seeing kids draw on shoes in school. But, I was never brave enough to try it, and if I did I am sure I did it on the bottoms of the shoes where my mom wouldn't find it.\nWe started our celebration for Mark Teague by rereading all our books in our personal collection.\nWe got out our brand new set of Sharpie markers to turn these plain white shoes into a work of art.\nWe talked about using a pencil first to plan out our designs. This lasted a little while and then my children found was easier to just let creativity lead the way in the design.\nMy youngest son was serious about his shoe decorating!\nIt seems like we have been doing a lot of projects in our pajamas recently.\nThe next thing we knew our youngest came in with one of her own shoes. I guess she felt left out.\nSo, we gave her an older pair of shoes and a Sharpie too.\nHe was happy with his first shoe!\nOne shoe finished and it fits good. Now to decorate the next one.\nThese fine lookin' shoes were created by my 3-year-old son.\nThese sweet lookin' shoes were created by my 6-year-old son.\nMy daughter thought they were pretty sweet too, so she stole them!\nFrom the moment I thought about doing this project with my children I wondered if they would wear the shoes. I am very surprised that my boys have worn them to school every day since making them.\nMy 8-year-old daughter just finished her shoes today and said that she won't wear them to school.\nThank you Mark Teague for inspiring us with your childhood story at the National Book Festival. Your enthusiasm for children's books is infectious! It was a highlight of our trip to meet you! Have a wonderful birthday!\nShe wore them to school!"}

{"text":"Background: Religiosity and spirituality have been found to be substantially associated with a variety of mental health and illness parameters. However, relevant empirical evidence is sparse, and more research is needed in order to further understand what role religiosity\/spirituality plays in the development, progression and healing process of a psychiatric disease. Thus, the purpose of this study was to find out more information about the religious\/spiritual needs of anxious\/depressive inpatients. Sampling and Methods: A total sample of 200 well-characterized anxious\/depressive inpatients was investigated. Results were compared to those from an adjusted group of healthy individuals (n = 200). A newly developed Multidimensional Inventory for Religious\/Spiritual Well-Being was applied to both groups, together with established psychiatric measures (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory). Results: Of the dimensions measured, Hope and Forgiveness turned out to be the strongest negative correlates of anxious\/depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). Moreover,a lower degree of Hope (p < 0.001) and Experiences of Sense and Meaning (p < 0.01) was found in the patient group compared to healthy controls. In accordance with the literature, religiosity was confirmed to be a substantial suicidal buffer (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our results account for a more comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, emphasizing in particular the role that religiosity\/spirituality plays in overall well-being. Furthermore, religious\/spiritual well-being might be considered an important resource to explore, in particular for affective mentally disordered patients."}

{"text":"Three experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drugs have been chosen for a worldwide clinical study by the Washington University in St. Louis, US. The aim of the study is to determine whether these drugs can prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe pioneering trial is expected to begin in early 2013 and initially will test three promising drugs, each designed to target Alzheimer\u2019s in different ways. The drugs chosen are gantenerumab (an antibody made by Roche), solanezumab and a beta-secretase inhibitor (both made by Eli Lilly). The trial is supported by a US $4.2 million grant from the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, plus Roche and Lilly have agreed to make the treatments available at no cost to the investigators.\nThe study will seek to identify whether the drugs can improve Alzheimer\u2019s disease biomarkers and effectively prevent the loss of cognitive function, in people with inherited mutations that cause early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. The clinical trials will involve 160 people who have inherited mutations that mean they are almost certain to develop Alzheimer\u2019s at a young age, typically in their 30s, 40s or 50s.\nPrincipal investigator Randall Bateman, MD and Joanne Knight, Distinguished Professor in Neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\nThis new trial is planned to last for two years, but will be expanded and extended if one or more of the drugs are effective in slowing or stopping indicators of presymptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nLuca Santarelli, head of Roche Neurosciences."}

{"text":"Dried spent yeast (DSY) was used as a low-cost nitrogen supplement for ethanol fermentation from sweet sorghum juice under very high gravity (VHG) conditions by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NP 01. The fermentation was carried out at 30\u00baC in a 5-litre bioreactor. The results showed that DSY promoted ethanol production efficiencies. The ethanol concentration (P), productivity (Qp) and yield (Yp\/s) of the sterile juice (total sugar of 280 g l-1) supplemented with 8 g l-1 of DSY were not different from those supplemented with yeast extract and\/or peptone at the same amount. The initial yeast cell concentration of 5 x 107 cells ml-1 was found to be optimal for scale-up ethanol production. In addition, an increase in sugar concentration in inoculum preparation medium (from 10 to 100 g l-1) improved the ability of the inoculum to produce ethanol under the VHG conditions. When S. cerevisiae NP 01 grown in the juice containing 100 g l-1 of total sugar was used as the inoculum for ethanol fermentation, the P, Qp and Yp\/s obtained were 108.98 \u00b1 1.16 g l-1, 2.27 \u00b1 0.06 g l-1 h-1 and 0.47 \u00b1 0.01 g g-1, respectively. Similar results were also observed when the ethanol fermentation was scaled up to a 50-litre bioreactor under the same conditions. The cost of the sweet sorghum for ethanol production was US$ 0.63 per litre of ethanol. These results clearly indicate the high potential of using sweet sorghum juice supplemented with DSY under VHG fermentation for ethanol production in industrial applications."}

This is putting the cabinet that would have gone in the street into the basements of buildings. Except it\u2019s not a cabinet but a rack.\nIt\u2019s less innovation and more negotiation, and what makes it worth noting is that BT is prepared to square things with landlords for a rack which lets other ISPs use the installation in the same way as they would if it were in the street.\nWithin the building it\u2019s plain old copper, but then this is precisely the kind of application which is being targeted at G.fast.\nThe trial is taking place in two City of London buildings from next month: 225 homes in the Middlesex Street Estate and around 50 SMEs based at 65 London Wall will have access to download speeds of up to 80Mbps from more than 130 different service providers for the first time.\n\u201cCity centre locations present unique challenges when it comes to upgrading consumer broadband. For example, there is less room for us to install a fibre cabinet on the pavement, and it is often harder to get permission to close roads to do the work.

{"text":"I have been really good lately and have stayed away from sweets, cakes and all junk food. So has my husband, but he had his PT test today and passed, so to celebrate, I decided to make a dessert for after dinner.\nI don't do this very often, actually, when I do make any kind of desserts it is during the weekend.\nBut, I am in the mood for cake, and not a boxed cake or just any kind of cake. I was in the mood for a good old Portuguese cake with a nice egg cream in the center. Creme de Ovos (egg cream\/custard) is one of my favorite things on earth, but I never make it, it's been many years.\nToday seemed like the perfect time, so here it is....a nice simple cake with a layer of egg custard in the middle and poured over the top, sprinkled with some powdered sugar and you have a divine dessert that your family will love.\nFirst make the egg cream. Add the water and sugar to a saucepan and boil for 3 minutes over medium heat. Add the egg yolks to a bowl and stir well. Pour the sugar water mixture into the bowl, a little at a time and mixing constantly. Pour the whole mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat until thickened. Transfer to a bowl and let cool.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a cake pan. In a medium bowl, beat the sugar with the butter, next add in the eggs one at a time beating well after each. Add in the milk, alternating with the flour, lastly, add the baking powder and mix everything well. Pour into the cake pan and bake for 40 minutes.\nUse a toothpick to see if the cake is done. Remove from the oven and invert the cake onto a plate. Let cool completely.\nCut the cake in half, spread about 1\/4 of the egg cream on one of the halves, top with the other half, then smear the rest of the egg cream over the top. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and cinnamon, if you wish.\nMy grandma used make this bolo all the time. Loved it as a kid. Haven't had it in ages, I should give it a try. Thanks!\nOh Sandra, that looks so good !"}

{"text":"Every time I visit my daughter and grandchildren in Amarillo, Texas I am reminded of one of my not-so-finer moments in the world of wine.\nA few years ago my daughter and her family moved from the cotton fields of Lubbock to the cattle ranches and feed lots of Amarillo. During my first visit I was introduced to Amarillo\u2019s unique \u201cpungent\u201d bouquet when the wind blows out of the West. The first whiff and I knew I was in cattle country.\nDuring that same visit I flew to Dallas for winery business. The colleague I was to meet had scored tickets to a wine tasting at a historical and elegant 5-star restaurant. The tasting was kept to an intimate 25 people, dress was cocktail casual and the wines had been handpicked by the head sommelier. I could hardly wait!\nIn tux attire, the sommelier greeted most of his guests by name. I was introduced as the owner of Olympic Cellars in Washington State. That started a bit of conversation amongst the guests who favored French wines and California Cabernets\u2026 but had heard a lot of good things about Washington wines!\nNow normally, I taste and spit at these types of events. I\u2019m a bit of a lightweight and know my limits, especially when it comes to keeping my \u201cmouth\u201d in check.\nAaah, but these wines were heaven in a bottle and as each wine was poured, my will power lessoned and I began to savor each velvety sip. The evening\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was a famous old French Bordeaux (even I recognized the name). As this wine was poured, the atmosphere of the room changed\u2026 hushed voices that were almost reverent replaced the boisterous conversations of before.\nAnticipating nirvana, I swirled the wine and gently lowered my nose to the glass. Deeply inhaling, my senses suddenly were sent careening and I spoke before my brain engaged; \u201cThis wine smells like AMARILLO\u201d, I said none to quietly.\nBut the room did get quiet \u2013 real quiet \u2013 as the sommelier slowly walked to our table and stood right in front of me. \u201cMadame, that is nose of fine old Bordeaux with just a hint of the barnyard\u201d, he said with stern dignity, putting me in my place.\n\u201cWell frankly I think the barnyard has a little too much horse manure!\u201d I retorted.\nWhoops\u2026 I really stepped in \u201cit\u201d this time. Should have spit and kept my mouth shut.\nBut really, the wine by any other name or price tag WOULD have been poured down the drain.\nBut what do I know. Almost all the guests ranked the wine #1.\nWell, having graduated from Texas Tech in Lubbock, I'm VERY familiar with the smell of Feed lots!! I completely understand!"}

{"text":"When you have had a footballing career as glittering as Ally McCoist&rsquo;s, you would maybe think that winning the IRN-BRU SFL Phenomenal Manager of the Month Award for the Third Division would be no big deal.\nWhen you have had a footballing career as glittering as Ally McCoist\u2019s, you would maybe think that winning the IRN-BRU Phenomenal Manager of the Month Award for the Third Division would be no big deal.\nWell if you do, you would be wrong, for McCoist was delighted to be chosen after his side\u2019s six game winning run last month and to him, the Award means more than just recognising a fine run by his men.\nMcCoist explained: \u201cI see this award as marking the end of one chapter and hopefully, marking the start of another chapter.\nMcCoist continued: \u201cThat opportunity gave us the chance to rebuild for which we are very, very thankful for.\n\u201cAfter being voted out of the SPL, it was mooted that we would play in the First Division and, we would have accepted playing there, as all we wanted was an opportunity to play football. However, the more the fans thought about things and the more the people at the club thought about things, the Third Division was the right place to go.\nIt would not seem feasible that a 61 times capped Scotland player would form a strong bond with a former submariner that is also the Chairman of a Third Division part-time club but that is exactly what happened back in July as Rangers\u2019 fate was discussed.\nMcCoist said: \u201cOne of the biggest memories of the whole debacle we were in from 14th February last year was that in the meeting with the SFL clubs back in July, we were welcomed in. I will never forget Tony Ford of East Stirling welcoming me and everyone from the club. He was the first person to welcome us to anything in a long time. A great gesture by a great man and something I on behalf of the club will never forget.\nMcCoist explained his view further saying: \u201cI have been asked the question about the award already and in many ways, I feel the question should be asked back the way about why it should not mean as much as something else.\n\u201cIt means a lot as it is a reward for you and your players for the success they have seen during the month of the only division we are playing in. People might want to compare it to the SPL award I won last season and say it is a lesser league but you can only be judged, and hopefully rewarded on, what you are capable of winning.\nYoung Ibrox midfielder Lewis Macleod beat his Manager to an IRN-BRU SFL Award by a month after picking up November\u2019s Young Player of the Month accolade and the 18-year-old and his young colleagues were given praise by McCoist.\nThe Ibrox boss said: \u201cHe may have won his award a month earlier than me but I was delighted for him as he has been fabulous. In fact, Lewis and all our young kids have been great especially in very difficult times.\nMcCoist added: \u201cWe had players that would be leaving, and others that were on trial, so we started with a makeshift team. People have perhaps forgotten all the aspects we faced and players sometimes do not get the credit for the way they have handled things.\nThe youngsters are learning their trade in the same manner McCoist did when he was a teenage striker at St. Johnstone back in the early eighties.\nThe Ibrox boss said: \u201cThat is a fair comparison, in fact it is a one hundred percent accurate comparison. I wasn\u2019t at a club that is the size of Rangers but I was Lewis Macleod in terms of being a 17-year-old and playing against Berwick Rangers.\nPlaying for St. Johnstone gave McCoist an early platform to show off his penchant for goals and he brought it to a national audience back in March, 1981 with the aid of wintry weather that had gripped Scotland.\nMcCoist explained: \u201cSt. Johnstone played Berwick and a whole lot of games were called off but Muirton was in its usual terrific condition and our game went on. Scotsport had a set of cameras at Perth Ice Rink to cover a curling tournament so as we were still on, they sent them over to film our First Division game.\nSix months later, McCoist was at Sunderland in the top division in England and he joked: \u201cHere I am back playing Berwick again.\nAs for winning more IRN-BRU SFL Awards, McCoist said: \u201cI would think that as a team and individuals, we are in a different scenario to most sides as the consensus is that we should be top of the division. I can understand that.\n\u201cIf we are fortunate to win the title, we may not be presented with Young Player, Player and Manager of the Year Awards as some people may see it as doing only what is expected."}

{"text":"\u201cNow,\u201d Paul says, \u201cit\u2019s time to forgive and console\u201d this person who had made life so \u2018painful\u2019 for Paul so that he won\u2019t be overwhelmed by guilt, shame, sorrow. \u201cReaffirm your love for him\u201d Paul tells the Corinthians.\nBecause the first word of the second chapter of II Corinthians is \u201cSo\u201d we have to start with the last words of the first chapter. Paul writes: \u201cI do not mean to imply that we lord it over your faith; rather, we are workers with you for your joy, because you stand firm in the faith. Paul gets to \u201cSo\u201d by telling the church in Corinth that he and they are co-workers for their joy and that they stand firm in the faith.\n\u201cSo\u201d Paul writes \u201cI made up my mind not to make you another painful visit. Another \u201cpainful visit\u201d? That implies that there was a previous visit that turned out to be painful. What we will soon learn is that instead of a return engagement Paul wrote a \u2018painful letter\u2019. It was out of distress and anguish of heart and with tears that it was written. That suggests that what had made the previous visit painful was no little consequence. It\u2019s generally accepted that he had left Ephesus for Thessaloniki or Philippi as many as three years after his visit to Corinth. Paul had travelled from Corinth into Asia, carrying the Gospel and carried the offense done to him in his heart, almost like a treasure. And it was only after some time on the road he writes a letter, a severe letter, unloading on these people in Corinth. Talking about holding a grudge.\nII Corinthians gets overlooked because it doesn\u2019t fit our idea of a contiguous correspondence. There is an undeniable incongruity between the first part which is conciliatory and gratifying and which makes direct reference to a painful, regretted letter and the last, beginning with the 10th chapter, were we are reading about personal misunderstandings and bitterness. The possibility suggests itself that what we actually have in chapters 10-13 is Paul\u2019s painful letter.\nAnother interesting thing about II Corinthians is that more than any other writing of the Apostle Paul, this letter reveals his human weaknesses, his holding onto wounded feelings, his sternness, irony, rebuke, impassioned self-vindication, but also his spiritual strength, the deepest tenderness of affection, humility, a justified self-respect, zeal for the welfare of the weak and suffering, as well as for the progress of the Christ\u2019s church and for the spiritual advancement of its members.\nHere he comes off a bit self serving when he says he wrote the letter in the sincere hope that what had happened before wouldn\u2019t be repeated when he made a subsequent visit. \u201cI wrote it as I did, so that when I came, I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice.\u201d It is something of an apology for if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? That\u2019s a story in itself. In a way it\u2019s freeing to know that Paul popped off, said a little more than he intended and hurt some people that he really didn\u2019t want to hurt at all. It was a Mills Brother\u2019s number one hit that comes to mind.\nIt finally occurs to Paul that his painful letter was a little too rough on the Meeting in Corinth. In retrospect he tells the Corinthians that he wrote it, as he says: not to cause you pain, but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you. But one thing was clear, it had caused a great deal of pain. I imagine that the awareness of the damage done came from others who had visited Corinth and reported the situation to Paul. I can even imagine that at first he dismissed it. Was it an important enough to distract him from the important work of ministry? But finally it did sink in. And he writes this letter to them.\n6This punishment by the majority is enough for such a person; 7so now instead you should forgive and console him, so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 8So I urge you to reaffirm your love for him. 9I wrote for this reason: to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything. 10Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ. 11And we do this so that we may not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.\nPaul says that the person who caused him \u2018pain\u2019 actually caused pain to the whole congregation and in response the congregation brought punishment on the perpetrator \u2013 and Paul says the punishment was enough. Now, Paul says, it\u2019s time to forgive and console this person so that he won\u2019t be overwhelmed by guilt, shame, sorrow. \u201cReaffirm your love for him\u201d Paul says.\nThe word translated as \u201cforgive\u201d in 2 Cor 2:7 is charizomai (\u201cto give freely\u201d), which is the same word Paul will use when he calls on them to \u201cgive freely\u201d to the collection for the poor in Jerusalem (in 2 Cor 8-9). The reason Paul so stresses the importance of forgiving \u2014 and the mutuality involved in his forgiving anyone they forgive \u2014 is that both he and the Corinthians all stand together before the \u201cface\u201d (prosopon) of Christ, the source of their life together. Indeed, he warns, we forgive so as not to be taken advantage of by Satan, whose intentions are to destroy any community we might have with one another through Christ.\nThis passage, as a whole, testifies to how damaging it can be to individuals and the Meeting should one person fails with regard to hospitality. But imagine how much greater that would be should that person believed in the very depth of their heart that Paul needed to be corrected. That can certainly be us, so certain of our understanding of right and wrong, of how things ought to be and keenly aware when things don\u2019t go as we believe they should. I\u2019m guessing that the lesson here has to do with a lack of humility and the need to judge another. Whatever, it certainly offended Paul. And Paul decided that despite telling the Corinthians he would made a return visit he changed his mind \u2013 going back would be too painful.\nAnd it follows how damaging it can be if someone persists in holding a grudge and then gives voices to it which draws everyone\u2019s attention to the failure of one among the many. It certainly weakened Paul\u2019s message, sapped his energy and created a distraction. Paul awakened to the need to be reconciled to his brothers and sisters in Christ.\nAnd then when the whole congregation brings sanctions upon the offender. Some groups practice shunning, is that what went on here? We aren\u2019t sure. Other groups practice excommunication \u2013 denying the offender table grace. How do we do that? Drawing lines between those on the inside and everyone else is done any number of ways. The way it\u2019s done isn\u2019t important. What we know is that when Paul learned of it he says \u201cenough!\u201d. He says, as much to himself as to the Corinthians, that it\u2019s necessary to forgive and console. The church just isn\u2019t the church without forgiveness. After all, we Christians understand ourselves first of all as people who need to be\u2014and have been\u2014forgiven by God. But then what does forgiveness mean? Does it mean, for instance, that once an apology has been offered and accepted, everything goes back to how it was before? Is forgiveness a reset button? Do victims have a say in setting future boundaries? Are there conditions that need to be met in order for forgiveness to take place? If we insist that victims extend unconditional forgiveness, isn\u2019t that grace for the offender, and law for the victim?\nFar too often we act as if forgiveness has to be earned, that there has to be evidence of repentance. God in Christ forgave us without any evidence of repentance on our part, without our doing anything at all to earn his forgiveness; and I think he expects us to follow his example in relation to others. We are to make others whole as we have been made whole ourselves. The disciples were told to forgive an uncomfortable number of times. When asked who our neighbor is, Jesus replied with the Parable of the Good Samaritan to show how we ourselves must be neighbors to others. We are to concentrate on what we can do, not on what we think someone else should do, but we have a tendency to waste time and effort on their sins and shortcomings which are much more visible to us than our own. We want to do the right thing but, like the Apostle Paul, we have the sinking feeling that all to often we fail. We forget that Christ came among us to deal with failure and restore us to fullness of life. It would be nice if all this came naturally, but in reality we are being asked stretch in ways we never thought possible. Jesus asked, Christ\u2019s Spirit asks, Paul asks us to experience more deeply than ever before God\u2019s unfailing love for us, and to share that love with others. We are being asked, not in any power of our own, but in the power of the Christ who abides within us, to become an aqueduct, a channel for the life-giving fountain which is Christ. That is no mean task for us all."}

When my schedule permits, I accept children\u2019s and YA titles (including picture books) set in specific locations for potential review. Merely mentioning a location is not sufficient. The location\u2019s history, culture, points of interest etc. must be woven through the plot line. Books created because of a location as in someone goes to visit\u2026 which do not have a substantial plot line outside of visiting points A, B and C are generally not suitable for review.

{"text":"They say the key to conquering your fear is to understand the thing you\u2019re afraid of. For instance, would it help to know that Megafobia, like every great rollercoaster throughout the world, has no engine? Once the coaster launches down that first drop, you\u2019re flying around the track on pure kinetic energy. Has that set your mind at ease? No? Well, this might help you: Behind every thrilling circuit of a rollercoaster are many hours of skilled research, design and engineering. Here\u2019s the inside track on how rollercoasters do what they do.\nThese people look at ways to scare you before the rollercoaster has even moved. These devious psychologists have actually identified the moment the lap bar is secured around your waist as one of the most exciting parts of the ride. Because that\u2019s the moment of no return, and your sense of anticipation does the rest.\nEvery inch of track must be calculated. The design team need to get the first drop just right, as this provides the energy the carriage needs to hurtle around the whole track. After that, the g-force needs to be checked to ensure it doesn\u2019t exceed 10gs \u2013 at which point, you can pass out. But don\u2019t worry, the most you\u2019ll see in your average rollercoaster is 3.5gs.\nBefore the real work of construction begins, designers usually create a prototype to test out any new features on the rollercoaster. This is where a carriage full of water filled dummies get to have the first ride. Depending on how these dummies fare, final alterations and tweaks will be carried out on the design.\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed your favourite theme parks often close for a while, and that\u2019s when the real work begins. Steel coasters tend to be constructed bit by bit and then shipped in, whilst wooden coasters, like Megafobia are built carefully piece-by-piece on site. It\u2019s a slow and careful process, because every bolt must be tightened, checked, and checked again.\nPro tip: The further back in the carriage you sit, the faster you\u2019ll whip over the drop. So whilst you won\u2019t get the best view, you\u2019ll get the biggest thrill.\nSo, how does a roller coaster stick to its tracks as it goes upside down? It\u2019s actually a simple matter of cheating gravity \u2013 for a few seconds, at least. The acceleration you\u2019ve gained from that big hill you\u2019ve just been winched up is strong enough that it defeats the tug of gravity as you loop-the-loop. Don\u2019t let us stop you from gripping the handrail if it makes you feel better though.\nWe\u2019ve got the UK\u2019s number-one wooden rollercoaster, raved about by obsessives throughout the world! And Speed is our steel coaster, so you can try both and decide for yourself which is better, wood or steel. We\u2019re chock full of attractions for families and large groups too, so for thrill seekers and attraction lovers alike, we\u2019ve got all the bases covered."}
{"text":"With a New Cold War mentality in Whitehall, Rob Brown suggests we treat MoD spin with the same skepticism as that from Moscow.\nFor most of us the clocks went forward an hour at the weekend to usher in the start of British summer time. But for some folk they went back about five decades \u2013 to the darkest period of the Cold War \u2013 as Typhoon fighter jets were \u201cscrambled\u201d from RAF Lossiemouth to \u201cintercept\u201d Russian aircraft over the North Sea.\nI might have made a frightened dash for Scotland\u2019s Secret Bunker near St. Andrews had I not collapsed in a heap of laughter when I read in the Daily Express that a \u2018military source\u2019 described this denouement as \u201can outrageous bid to further destabilise the nation\u201d on Brexit Day.\nHow strange then that such \u2018incursions\u2019 were being regularly reported long before Boris and Farage pulled off their wafer-thin referendum triumph. According to a statement attributed last summer to the minister of state for the armed forces, Mark Lancaster, the RAF has had to scramble jets to intercept Russian military aircraft more than 80 times over the last decade.\nI almost choked on a Cornish pasty when I was heading up a journalism school down in Falmouth and heard about one such reported incident off the coast of Cornwall. The only difference was the Typhoons that time were launched from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire.\nPerhaps we shall have to fight them on the beaches as well as up in the sky? The Royal Navy claims to have responded to Russian military ships approaching UK territorial waters 33 times in 2017 compared to just once in 2010.\nWe\u2019re in a \u201cnew age of warfare\u201d, according to the defence secretary, who tells us to \u201clook at Russia\u2019s resurgence under President Putin\u201d. This is standard issue sabre-rattling from neocon hawks who have yearned for a New Cold War almost from the moment the Berlin Wall was reduced to rubble.\nGavin Williamson\u2019s lauding of \u201cour brave RAF pilots\u201d for having \u201cshown again that we are ready to respond to any threat to the UK\u201d made it sound as though they were performing the same valiant feats as the men who heroically manned Spitfires in the Battle of Britain. But nobody presently based on the Moray Firth has engaged in any perilous encounter, far less aerial combat, with any Russian adversary.\nBy repeatedly scrambling fighter jets from various bases, the Ministry of Defence has been conjuring up phantom duels in our imaginations as part of its ongoing struggle for a substantially bigger budget. It is time our minds were unscrambled.\nThe \u201cincreasing aggressiveness\u201d Williamson attributed to Putin wasn\u2019t coming on this occasion from the judo wrestler in the Kremlin but from himself as he arm-wrestled Philip Hammond for more money for the MoD.\nWar games in Whitehall are almost as rough as those currently underway across the far north of Scotland.The boys need to play with their toys and Scotland provides a splendid biannual playground for such earnest amusement. Joint Warrior they call it because it is a tri-service exercise involving the RAF, the Royal Navy and the British Army.\nTogether with comrades-in-arms from other Nato states, British servicemen are currently spending a full fortnight launching mock airborne assaults and amphibious landings. There\u2019s also training in counter-insurgency, counter-piracy and interstate warfare, as well as live fire exercises on the weapon range at Cape Wrath.\nAll sounds such spiffing fun it\u2019s a wonder the highlights don\u2019t get televised by the BBC, with Huw Edwards providing the solemn, sonorous commentary as he does so well on Remembrance Sunday or for Royal Weddings.\nSeemingly the best bit is when Russian aircraft streak along the fringes of Britain\u2019s sovereign airspace to try to sneak a look at what\u2019s going on in the bens and glens. But the only footage of that is shot by Putin\u2019s propagandists, apparently, and supplied exclusively to RT (possibly for Alex Salmond\u2019s amusement in between his studio recordings).\nAll the British media receive from the MoD are grainy aerial photos of RAF Typhoons or Voyagers monitoring Russian Blackjacks. Still, more than enough to get graphic artists on the Daily Mail and The Sun scrambling to produce \u2018Aggression of the Bear\u2019 side-panels to accompany panting news analysis pieces about Moscow\u2019s military muscle-flexing.\nJingoism and journalism have been lusty bedfellows since the golden age of Fleet Street. And the relationship has not withered since the last ink-stained hacks abandoned their old battered typewriters for characterless computerised newsrooms and tonier watering holes.\nNot that the outpourings of what was once called the White Commonwealth Press matter nearly so much nowadays. Britain\u2019s dominant source of news \u2013 north as well as south of the Border \u2013 remains by far the BBC. And Britain\u2019s semi-state broadcasting service can always be counted upon to pump out the official MoD line.\nWhat about Russia\u2019s response to such gung-ho rhetoric? You guessed it \u2013 not a single syllable, on any of its mushrooming channels and radio stations or on its sprawling website. This is par for the course: very rarely do we hear the Kremlin\u2019s side of this long running story, despite the fact it has been frequently proffered.\nReuters did report the Russian embassy in London scolding Britain for plotting to undermine Moscow\u2019s international image. \u201cWe consider these and similar statements as a PR exercise, meant to demonstrate some assumed \u2018aggressiveness\u2019 from Russia, as well as panache of certain British politicians,\u201d said its spokesman.\n\u201cRussian planes carry out the routine flights in international airspace over the North, Barents and Norwegian seas. This doesn\u2019t sound scary or, in fact, interesting to the public. But, with some creativity and juggling of words, the story sounds quite different.\nKremlin spin doctors might not ooze massive credibility when they comment on Crimea or Chechnya \u2013 or on the murder of opposition politicians and probing journalists in Moscow \u2013 but a cursory read between the lines of MoD statements and briefings soon reveals that the above rebuttals by Russia are, for once, soundly based.\nFailure to report that counter-narrative renders the BBC no more reliable than RT. In fact, it makes our so-called public service broadcaster almost as untrustworthy as the old Soviet Communist Party\u2019s propaganda sheets. At least the Russians weren\u2019t legally compelled to purchase an annual license to fund Pravda.\nThe latest yarn about RAF fighter jets having to be scrambled from Lossiemouth probably is loosely connected to Brexit and the further destabilization of the Anglo-Scottish Union resulting from that bourach. Doubtless the intended outcome \u2013 by the MoD \u2013 is that those pesky Scot Nats will all pipe down again and be eternally grateful for still being an integral part of a leading world power that can repel such aerial aggression.\nIt\u2019s time for Scotland to set aside such retro anti-Red scaremongering and reclaim her land, sea and sky. Then let\u2019s see who launches incursions into our sovereign airspace and territorial waters. If history and geography are our guides, any threat to our national security is likely to stem from somewhere a lot nearer to us than Russia.\nI wonder who else the British army has pictures of that they use for target practice?\nI imagine anyone whose politics are left of Genghis Khan would be in the frame,so to speak.\nOn that basis,Putin probably wouldn\u2019t qualify.\nThe British armed forces and HM Press are essentially the enforcer for the right wing British establishment.\nAnd, where will the four nuclear dildos based at Faslane go?\nSeems more than a coincidence that the particular regiment who carried out the massacres of civilians in Bloody Sunday and Coalsland in NI is the same regiment caught training shooting at pictures of Jeremy Corbyn.\nIndeed, I think one can take it that this particular regiment is fully trained, armed and ready to do exactly the same bidding again should separists need taught a lesson. Nicola Sturgeon, Alex Salmond or indeed anyone else independence minded take heed. Ultimately, if vote manipulation by the dark arts services doesn\u2019t work this is how the U.K. will react against Scottish Independence."}

{"text":"Improving the experiential experience for shoppers in the leading APAC nation, Innisfree teams ups with Alibaba to introduce new technology and apply the New Retail business model.\nKorean cosmetics giant, Innisfree, has entered into a digital revitalisation plan in China. Its Hangzhou store, in particular, is introducing New Retail features to boost its position as a dominating beauty brand.\nThe New Retail store now contains an assortment of interactive technologies provided by Alibaba's Tmall, a business-to-consumer (B2C) online retail website.\nDesigned to make shopping easier, more enjoyable and match rapidly changing consumer needs, Alibaba\u2019s founder Jack Ma first established the New Retail business model in 2016.\nNew Retail utilises technology to bring together the individual strengths and popularity of offline physical in-store shopping with online interactive experiences. By merging the two, Alibaba hopes to create \u201c\u200bone comprehensive channel to benefit consumers and brands\u201d\u200b.\nStriving to benefit both customers and merchants, it offers fun, lively and convenient buying options for the former and holistic and rich insights into customers' buying preferences for the latter. With this invaluable information, brands are then able to develop more insightful marketing strategies, campaigns and product formulations.\n\u201cBrands that remain fashionable over time are those which best understand consumer behaviour, and that is why we think New Retail is so important for businesses in the future,\u201d\u200b revealed Mike Hu, the president of Tmall Fast-Moving Consumer Goods.\nHailed as 'Innisfree x Tmall New Retail Store', its Hangzhou store uses games, entertainment, education and personalised offerings to promote its new makeover.\n\u201cTmall\u2019s technology and experience will undoubtedly play a vital role in formulating our New Retail layout in the Chinese market,\u201d\u200b emphasised Filipp Cai, general manager of Innisfree China.\nThere are a number of features that appear in New Retail stores to encourage engagement and interaction from a customer perspective.\nAugmented-reality (AR) technology enables customers to try out various make up options virtually. Beauty buyers can then purchase in-store, order immediately from Innisfree's flagship store or scan a QR code with their Mobile Taobao app.\nCustomers can place a high-precision camera on various parts of the face, which then analyses these images and instantaneously generates an in-depth report of their skin condition. A QR code can then be scanned and a detailed report outlining ideal products is then produced.\nUsing the Taobao app, shoppers can scan a QR code, receive discounts and make their purchases.\nIn-store displays contain a sensor-equipped shelf that reveals product details on a touchscreen. Once they have picked up a product, customers can learn more, before buying.\nIf physical stores have limited space, brands can activate this technology, which allows customers to see all of the brand's product portfolio on the Innisfree Tmall flagship store, not only those available at the physical store.\nBrand members can take photos through the AR interactive big screen. Utilising influencer marketing, Innisfree\u2019s brand ambassadors, Chinese boy band Nine Percent, are also present.\nScanning the QR code on the machine enables shoppers to enter Innisfree\u2019s membership programme and win three tries at grabbing a free sample.\nWith over 500 stores in China, Bailey also adds that Innisfree will be \u201csuper-powered\u201d, \u200bhighlighting the importance and ability of innisfree to use social media platforms and influencer marketing through Korean celebrities, successfully."}
{"text":"Am I the only one who\u2019s read one of these?\nI\u2019m sure many of you reading this think you are fully aware of how to win a game of the Pokemon Trading Card Game. \u201cTake six Prize cards, of course! You can also win by Knocking Out your opponent\u2019s last Pokemon in play, or if your opponent runs out of cards in their deck. Everyone who\u2019s read the rulebook can tell you that.\u201d Yes, how silly of me. Everyone does know that. Any newcomer knows these win conditions just as well as the best player in the world. Yet, the best player in the world will win games more often than the newcomer. Why is that exactly? While both of these players know how to win, only the best player knows how to win; or, rather, knows the path to victory that is most likely to succeed. In fact, I would go so far as to say that knowing their path to victory directly contributed to making those players better \u2014 high-tier optimization came naturally as a result of playing towards their win condition.\nA lack of direction isn\u2019t just a problem for beginners, either. All the time I see mid-level players who are clearly not playing toward their easiest win condition. They\u2019ll make plays that don\u2019t help them win, or miss a key play that could have swung the game in their favor. This lack of awareness can cost you games that were in your control the whole time. On the other side of this spectrum, I have seen pro players make miraculous comebacks because they were able to identify their best win condition during the game and perfectly execute it.\nHow do they figure out that win condition, you may ask? That\u2019s the question I intend to answer today. I will go over the method I use to determine the easiest way to win a game of Pokemon \u2014 a skill anyone can benefit from. First, though, I think it is necessary to define a few in-game concepts that will help you wrap your head around the complex puzzle that is figuring out your best path to victory.\nMost of you reading this are probably unfamiliar with me, so let me introduce myself before I go any further. I\u2019ve been playing this game casually since all the way back to 2001, but only in 2012 did I start participating in competitive tournaments in the Delaware area. Since then, I have achieved some great accomplishments in the Masters division, including winning the 2016 Pennsylvania State Championships, placing 19th at the National Championships the same year, winning half a dozen League Cups, and qualifying for the World Championships three times. I have also been a PokeBeach staff member since 2014, starting out as a forum moderator and eventually climbing my way up to co-head of the article program.\nMy deck-building skills have never been what sets me apart from my other local players \u2014 nor is it my metagaming or knowledge of specific matchups. No, my success is most commonly a result of my in-game fundamentals: I can pick up any deck, good or bad, and formulate a gameplan to defeat whomever I\u2019m sitting across from. I\u2019ve been able to pull games out of my\u2026 Grass Energy that I had no right to win \u2014 other times I fail horribly, especially if I\u2019ve never played the deck before, but even in the games I lose I always have a plan, and I attribute that to the concepts I\u2019m going to highlight in this article.\nAn event that begins once both players\u2019 boards are established to the point where they can use relevant attacks in succession until one player wins the game. It is no longer considered a Prize trade if one player misses a relevant attack, either because they whiffed a necessary card or because the opponent disrupted them.\nNot that kind of trading!\nThis term in action might be what you call a \u201cback-and-forth game\u201d. This back-and-forth starts at a specific point in the game, at which point it becomes a Prize trade. In most matchups, that point is usually the mid game, roughly turn three or four, but it doesn\u2019t have to to be considered a Prize trade.\nIt\u2019s important to understand the concept of the Prize trade because walking into one could lose you the game right there. If it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019re going to get all of your Prize cards first, by all means, hit things until you win\u2026 but if your opponent is going to win first, you\u2019ve sealed your own fate by engaging in a Prize trade. Unless you can somehow disrupt your opponent\u2019s strategy, you\u2019re falling right into your opponent\u2019s trap.\nSetting up for a Prize trade is pretty simple. The biggest thing you will need to do is establish enough attackers to last for the whole game; this includes all the necessary Energy, Tools, Stadiums, support Pokemon such as Malamar, etc. that allow them to function. Then, make sure you have any cards you need to play at a specific time in your hand, such as Guzma. Setting up draw support Pokemon such as Zoroark-GX, Oranguru, or Magcargo can help you get those cards back if your hand is disrupted.\nWhen to begin the Prize trade is more complicated. It\u2019s always important to analyze the state of both players\u2019 boards before doing so.\nAs I said earlier, don\u2019t jump right into a Prize trade if you can\u2019t keep up with your opponent. Instead of starting a Prize trade that you can\u2019t finish, some things you can do are leave your attacker on the Bench and wait until you have a second one, spread out your Energy so your opponent can\u2019t wipe out all of your attachments with one attack, or draw\/thin more cards from your deck so you are more likely to draw what you need for the rest of the game. These are all greats tactics to help stabilize your board before a Prize trade begins.\nYou can still start a Prize trade if you don\u2019t have all of your attackers set up; but if, based on your assumptions, you drawing what you need to win is less likely than your opponent drawing what they need to win, you may need to focus on finding the cards you\u2019ll need for the rest of the game before going all in on grabbing those Prizes.\nThat\u2019s all good if the Prize trade will work in your favor, but how should you go about entering a Prize trade if it favors your opponent? Even if your opponent\u2019s ideal board would stomp yours, you may not have anything to worry about if they are currently unable to deliver ideal attacks. For example, if your opponent only has one attacker set up that is easy for you to Knock Out, or is unlikely to hit a specific card they need to confirm their next KO such as Professor Kukui or Counter Energy, going into a Prize trade may be a good idea.\nFinally, there are a few things you can do during Prize trades to win them more often than not.\nIf you\u2019re trying to turn around a Prize trade that\u2019s not going in your favor, figure out what\u2019s allowing your opponent to pull off their best attack every turn. Is it a support Pokemon? How about their large hand size? Maybe it\u2019s the Choice Bands or Beast Energy Prism Star they already have in play? Always look for little ways to make your opponent more likely to whiff a Knock Out.\nIf you\u2019re ahead on Prizes, make sure to patch up any holes in your board when possible. If you\u2019re relying on a support Pokemon, a large hand, or cards in play, a good opponent is going to capitalize on that. Make sure you\u2019re prepared to deal with your opponent\u2019s disruptive tactics, or you might let a winning game slip out of your hands.\nOne reason the Prize trade isn\u2019t going in your favor could be the attackers you\u2019re using. Using bulky attackers that your opponent can\u2019t OHKO or non-GX Pokemon is a great way to swing a game into your favor.\nThe key to any successful Prize-denying tactics is understanding your opponent\u2019s deck enough that you know what will slow them down while also giving you an opening to gain the lead if needed.\nAny play that contributes toward that player\u2019s win condition and does damage to\/Knocks Out the opponent\u2019s Pokemon that they need to win.\nPressure is one of the most effective tactics you can employ in a game of Pokemon. It\u2019s been the primary strategy of countless tier-one decks throughout the history of this game, such as Buzzwole-GX \/ Lycanroc-GX, Darkrai-EX variants, Tornadus-EX variants, the original Haymaker, and so many more.\nWhen one of your attackers or support Pokemon gets Knocked Out, you need to replace it. That means finding the Pokemon itself, the Energy or Tool needed to attack, and the replacement for it once it inevitably gets Knocked Out too. This may require playing a draw Supporter, meaning you can\u2019t use a utility Supporter like Guzma or Acerola on the same turn; and, since drawing cards is inherently random, you may not find the cards at all despite going through a good chunk of your deck. But what makes pressure so scary is that your opponent is nabbing themselves some Prizes while they\u2019re applying it. It\u2019s effectively putting you on a clock: either you set up through the damage you\u2019re taking and start taking Prizes, or you will lose in X amount of turns. Sometimes you\u2019ll lose before you even have a chance to set up.\nOne deck in the current format that is excellent at applying pressure is Zoroark-GX \/ Lycanroc-GX. Riotous Beating does enough damage to Knock Out any evolving Basic Pokemon and two-shot almost any Pokemon-GX, and with 4+ gust affects available to the deck and a highly consistent engine, the deck will win on turn seven (a combination of six one-shots on non-GX Pokemon or three two-shots on Pokemon-GX, minus the first turn where it doesn\u2019t attack) a good percent of the time. It can win even earlier if it can Knock Out a Pokemon-GX with Dangerous Rogue GX, Weakness, or damage modifiers like Choice Band and Professor Kukui. Of course, there are ways to prevent the deck from winning on turn seven, such as non-GX Pokemon that have enough HP to survive Riotous Beating, healing, or applying enough pressure of your own to cause them to miss an attack.\nThis is one reason why speed and consistency are so important in the Pokemon TCG. If you\u2019re being put on a clock, you\u2019ve gotta beat the clock \u2014 out-speeding your opponent\u2019s pressure is an easy way to ignore the clock you\u2019re being put under.\nApplying pressure is great, and it\u2019s usually a good move if you\u2019re able to do it; but are there ever times when you shouldn\u2019t?\nThe biggest downside of applying pressure is it can leave your attacker and the Energy needed to attack with it vulnerable. Being overly aggressive can backfire if your opponent set up as fast or even faster than you. You may want to save your attacker until you can get more value out of it, such as by giving it a Weakness Policy so it survives longer or finding a Guzma so it can attack something more valuable. However, if hitting your opponent\u2019s Active Pokemon is the most value that attacker is going to get this game and you don\u2019t need to put the necessary Energy elsewhere, there\u2019s no downside in using it to apply pressure.\nAny Pokemon that is capable of allowing a player to win the game before their opponent, either directly or indirectly.\nPokemon in it\u2019s simplest form is both players trying to stop each other from setting up threats while setting up threats of their own. Consistently setting up threats is one of the key elements that sets the tier-one decks apart from the unviable decks. Sometimes when I would build a rogue deck that didn\u2019t work, I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around why \u2014 I\u2019m sure many of you can relate. When I look back on these decks now, not having good enough threats was often the reason they failed.\nStep 1: Figure out how many turns it will take for your opponent to knock it out, and how many Prize cards that Pokemon will take before that happens. Is the amount of Prizes it takes before it goes down enough to win you the game, either directly or indirectly? If the answer is no, then it\u2019s not a threat. If the answer is yes, go to Step 2.\nStep 2: Apply Step 1 to each of your opponent\u2019s Pokemon to figure out if any of them can win your opponent the game. If none of them can, then your Pokemon is a threat. If one or more of them can, go to Step 3.\nStep 3: Compare the most threatening Pokemon that both players have. If your opponent\u2019s will win them the game before yours will win you the game, then your Pokemon is not a threat. If yours will win you the game first, then it is a threat.\nThere\u2019s one matchup that I think explains the concept of threats \u2014 and how to deal with them \u2014 better than any other: the Zoroark-GX \/ Lycanroc-GX mirror matchup.\nIn this matchup, Lycanroc-GX is the biggest threat. If the Lycanroc-GX is never Knocked Out, it can use Claw Slash on two Zoroark-GX to take four Prizes, then Dangerous Rogue GX any of the opponent\u2019s Pokemon-GX to win the game. Even if you can deal with the Lycanroc-GX, the mere fact that your opponent can use it to win in three turns makes it a threat. By powering one up, your opponent is basically telling you \u201cyou have to deal with this, or you lose.\u201d This is why, if your opponent has a Lycanroc-GX with enough Energy to attack, the best course of action is usually to either two-shot it or one-shot it with your own Dangerous Rogue GX. Even better than Knocking Out a Lycanroc-GX after it\u2019s taken Prizes is stopping your opponent from ever setting one up; the best ways to do this are by Knocking Out all of your opponent\u2019s Rockruff, or targeting your opponent\u2019s Energy so that they can\u2019t attach an Energy from their hand and use Multi Switch to power up a Lycanroc-GX in one turn.\nThere are some decks that are built around having tons of equally strong threats \u2014 so many, in fact, that trying to remove all of them is impossible if the deck is drawing well. The best example of this is Night March. The deck is designed to stream six Joltik\/Pumpkaboo\/Mew\/Marshadow-GX per game, all of which have equally threatening attacks. Cards like Special Charge, Rescue Stretcher, Shaymin-EX, and Teammates make this process a breeze. Against decks like this, it\u2019s often better to try and take Prizes as quickly as possible rather than try to neutralize all of their threats by knocking them out. It should be noted, though, that you can make the Pokemon less threatening in other ways, such as by playing Karen.\nThe first is to simply set up more than one threat \u2014 if your opponent deals with one, they\u2019ll still lose to the other. Let\u2019s take a look at a Malamar \/ Marshadow-GX deck as an example. If that deck has three or more Malamar in play, and enough Energy and a Necrozma-GX in the discard, each of their Marshadow-GX become a threat. Even if you Knock Out one Marshadow-GX, they can power up another one for a Prismatic Burst with little-to-no effort. This can put the opponent in checkmate if the Malamar player has few enough Prize cards.\nYou can tell I play this deck a lot.\nThe second is to apply pressure while powering up your bigger threat. If your Zoroark-GX is taking Prizes and removing opposing Pokemon from the board at too fast of a rate, your opponent may need to devote turns to respond to it or risk losing. If they decide to devote all of their time and resources to dealing with our Zoroark-GX, no obstacles will get in your way of setting up a Lycanroc-GX. Or, if they ignore the Zoroark-GX and go after the Lycanroc-GX, they\u2019ll also have to find a way to win before Zoroark-GX takes six Prizes.\nSome threats can be made much scarier if you get to a certain Prize count prior to setting them up. Going back to the Zoroark-GX \/ Lycanroc-GX mirror match example, Lycanroc-GX gets two-shot by Zoroark-GX or Tapu Lele-GX, so if you take two Prizes with an undamaged Lycanroc-GX, it will likely only get two more Prizes before it goes down. If you can get two Prizes with Zoroark-GX before going in with Lycanroc-GX, your opponent will have no way to stop it from taking the remainder of your Prizes outside of their own Lycanroc-GX.\nIf you know what your biggest threat is in a given matchup, you can do minor things to punish your opponent for responding to it. One of the best players in my area, Isaiah Rufus, took advantage of this in one of our top cut matches at a League Cup. In the Zoroark-GX \/ Lycanroc-GX mirror match, on his first turn going second, he elected to set up three Rockruff and two Zorua, then attached a Fighting Energy to his Rockruff. He could have gotten a third Zorua instead of a third Rockruff with his Brigette, but he specifically wanted this setup. This confused me at first \u2014 \u201cwouldn\u2019t he rather try to set up more Zoroark-GX to increase his consistency? Having more than two Rockruff down at a time is unnecessary, so what gives?\u201d After thinking about it though, this made perfect sense: he knew that I needed to remove his Energy from the board or risk going down several Prizes to a Lycanroc-GX; and, because he was going second, he assumed that I would draw the necessary cards to Knock Out the Rockruff on my following turn. This play utilizes many of the strategies I\u2019ve gone over in this section: he knew what his biggest threat to me was, set it up, then punished me for correctly responding to it.\nNow that we\u2019re all using the same definition for these three terms, we can use each of them to help you achieve that beautiful win condition I\u2019m sure you\u2019re eager to get more often.\nYou gotta have enough time!\nThis point may be obvious, but considering the amount of players I see who don\u2019t seem to understand this, it needs to be stated. When you\u2019re playing a game of Pokemon, you\u2019re not only trying to win the game, you\u2019re trying to win before your opponent. Every path to victory will eventually win you the game; but most of them are either too slow, or \u2014 and this is the key point \u2014 don\u2019t slow your opponent down enough in the process.\nWith that in mind, all of your in-game actions should either contribute to winning the game quicker, or slowing your opponent down. Ideally you want to make plays that do both at once, which, thankfully for us, often comes naturally when playing \u2014 Knocking Out your opponent\u2019s attacker gives you Prize cards and forces your opponent to find the resources necessary to replace that attacker.\nSometimes though, either due to your opponent\u2019s clever play or by happenstance, doing both at the same time is either a bad idea or unnecessary. If you\u2019re faced with the decision of having to do one or the other, you\u2019ll have to decide whether you think you will be able to win the game by taking Prizes as fast as possible before your opponent based on the way things are going. If you can, you should simply make plays that get you the win quickly. If you can\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to find a way to slow your opponent down and give yourself an opening to make a comeback.\nPlay Example #1: Using Guzma to bring up a Tapu Lele-GX and knocking it out with Buzzwole-GX\u2019s Knuckle Impact.\nThis example of a play is one that gets you closer to winning but doesn\u2019t necessarily slow your opponent down. Tapu Lele-GX yields two Prizes, moving you one third of the way toward your win condition \u2014 awesome for us, right? In most cases, however, Tapu Lele-GX doesn\u2019t help your opponent win faster while it\u2019s in play; it just takes up space on the Bench. You\u2019re also promoting a GX attacker with three Energy attached, making it susceptible to Gardevoir-GX\u2019s Infinite Force.\nSo while this play isn\u2019t necessarily bad, going after Tapu Lele-GX doesn\u2019t slow your opponent down as much as, say, Knocking Out your opponent\u2019s attackers or support Pokemon. It may be correct to speed the game up by taking some cheap Prizes if you think you can win before your opponent, but going for this play if your opponent is going to win faster is one of the worst mistakes I see players make. Don\u2019t be tempted by those easy Prize cards!\nPlay Example #2: Instead of Knocking Out Tapu Lele-GX, using Guzma to Knock Out your opponent\u2019s lone Kirlia with a Fairy Energy attached with Buzzwole-GX\u2019s Jet Punch.\nNow let\u2019s take a look at what happens if you go after a potential attacker instead of a Pokemon-GX. While this play gives you less Prizes, it will apply pressure to your opponent\u2019s board, and, as I said before, you want to apply pressure when applicable. Forcing your opponent to devote resources to replace the Kirlia makes it less likely that they will find what they need later on. Getting the Prizes is great, but your opponent missing an attack or crucial card can give you enough of a lead to secure victory.\nNote here that we\u2019re using Jet Punch instead of Knuckle Impact. By attacking with a Pokemon with less Energy attached, even if our opponent can get a Gardevoir-GX out, they are less likely to knock us out with Infinite Force.\nThis play would be better to go for if you\u2019re worried that your opponent\u2019s fully established board will overpower yours.\nNow we\u2019re talking! These plays are almost always ideal over only doing one or the other, for obvious reasons. Always go for these plays.\nPlay Example #3: Using Buzzwole-GX\u2019s Absorption GX to Knock Out your opponent\u2019s lone Gardevoir-GX.\nThis play combines the fast win time of Play Example #1 with the disruptive nature of Play Example #2. It\u2019s the best of both worlds!\nPlay Example #4: Using Buzzwole-GX\u2019s Absorption GX to Knock Out a Ralts when your opponent has a Kirlia with an Energy attached on the Bench.\nThis kind of play is underwhelming at best, and game-losing at worst. Attaching three Energy to a Buzzwole-GX is a big commitment. Unless it\u2019s done through Beast Ring, that\u2019s three turns of attachments that could have gone onto a Lyncaroc-GX or another Buzzwole-GX. By putting all those resources into one attacker and throwing it at our opponent recklessly, we risk losing all of that hard work to one attack. As for the remainder of the game, we may be unable to take the rest of our Prizes in the face of a fully-loaded Gardevoir-GX taking Prizes every turn.\nNote that we used Absorption GX here as well. Without our GX attack, we\u2019re even less capable of responding to a 230 HP Pokemon-GX.\nIn conclusion, unless you have a specific purpose for making this play that I\u2019ve overlooked here, it\u2019s a weak play that is detrimental to both of your goals.\nNow that we know what we need to do and have defined all of the necessary terms, how do we put it all together to help us win a game of Pokemon?\nFiguring out your win condition is easier if you know generally what your opponent\u2019s deck is designed to do. Below I will be talking about what to do in that case. If you don\u2019t know your opponent\u2019s deck though; either because it\u2019s early in the game and they haven\u2019t shown you any cards that reveal what deck they\u2019re using, or they\u2019re playing such nonsensical cards that you can\u2019t figure out how they all fit together; you should have a basic win condition that is pretty good at dealing with any opposing strategy. 99% of the time that win condition should either involve preparing for a Prize trade as quickly as possible or applying pressure.\nThe Prize Trade: Avoid It or Embrace It?\nYour starting point for figuring out your best strategy should be to play out a Prize trade scenario in your head where both decks are set up perfectly and don\u2019t whiff anything for the remainder of the game. In this scenario, which deck wins first? Once you\u2019ve figured that out, make an educated guess as to which deck is more likely to achieve this perfect board state first. Practicing the matchup can help you learn how the Prize trade will normally go, but it\u2019s not necessary to formulate your initial gameplan.\nNo one trades Prizes better than this little bug.\nIf your deck is more likely to achieve a perfect board state and will come out on top even if your opponent does as well, your strategy should be about getting to this state as quickly as possible. Get to a point where your board is so much stronger than your opponent\u2019s that they will be totally unable to beat you.\nIf your deck will always lose once your opponent\u2019s board state and hand reach this nirvana, you have to stop your opponent from getting there. Remember what I said about our two goals? Half of winning a game of Pokemon is winning before your opponent. If your win condition is inevitable in a certain number of turns, your opponent developing the perfect board may not be enough to make them win; they will have to find a different win condition, one that their deck may not be built to achieve reliably. In this kind of matchup, you will want to apply pressure as much as possible \u2014 make plays like Play Example #2 or #3. If your pressure isn\u2019t quick enough to stop your opponent from setting up, don\u2019t give up just yet: they may still whiff cards they need to secure that victory. Sticking it out until the end can get you a surprising amount of extra wins just by nature of chance.\nIf your deck is less likely to achieve a perfect state but will come out on top if both players achieve it, your strategy can still involve going for this scenario. This may be a little harder to pull off though. You may need to make some plays that will slow down your opponent\u2019s setup so that you\u2019ll get to yours first, or take some risks that will allow you to set up faster. If you think there\u2019s no hope of getting to that point before your opponent, you should simply try to win quickly. You should still be on the lookout for ways to achieve that perfect state \u2014 sometimes the opportunity presents itself when you least expect it.\nThe last big question that we still have to answer is how to figure out what that perfect board actually looks like.\nIt\u2019s quite simple, actually: a perfect board state is a board filled with threats, and a perfect hand is one that enables them to be threatening. The best kind of win condition is one where you develop Pokemon that can snag all of your Prizes cards and develop enough of them that your opponent can\u2019t remove all of them from play. On the flip-side, your opponent\u2019s best win condition will be to get as many threats into play as possible as well. If you\u2019re worried about losing to your opponent\u2019s perfect board, stop their threats from coming into play or win before they become threatening.\nNow that we\u2019ve got our strategy, we can jump right into the game and, as long as we follow that strategy, we\u2019ll win for sure, right? Well, it\u2019s not that simple. Once you add in the variables of luck and your opponent\u2019s skill level\/deck list, the strategy we came up with isn\u2019t going to play out the same way every time; other times it won\u2019t work at all! While you\u2019re playing the game, you need to continually evaluate your win condition to make sure it\u2019s still achievable. If it isn\u2019t, don\u2019t give up just yet! There\u2019s almost always a different path you can take to win every game you play \u2014 you just have to find it.\nFiguring out a backup strategy mid game can be done the same way you came up with the first one, but this time it needs to be in the context of the game you\u2019re playing. This means reevaluating which player a Prize trade will favor, how you can carry out that Prize trade, what will disrupt your opponent, and which Pokemon are threats. These factors all end up being different in every individual game you play. That\u2019s the joy of playing Pokemon: figuring out what you can do to win this time.\nYou may not have time to come up with a perfect new strategy during a tournament game, so you may just have to pick one that seems good and hope it works. This is where experience can be a great asset \u2014 knowing which strategies generally work and which ones don\u2019t will be immensely helpful when creating a new one on the fly.\nThis whole article has been about how to win if your goal is to take six Prizes, but what if you want to win through another win condition? Luckily, these same fundamentals can be applied to any of the other win conditions. If your goal is to mill your opponent a la Durant, any Pokemon that discards cards from your opponent\u2019s deck is a threat to them; if you\u2019re trying to run them out of resources with a Sylveon-GX deck, every Enhanced Hammer or Plumeria you play is applying pressure to your opponent, since it contributes to your win condition while slowing down your opponent; even if you\u2019re trying to win with the new Unown with the DAMAGE Ability, every Pokemon you set up to help you achieve the game-winning combo is considered a threat; and so on and so on.\nSometimes even a normal deck can go for one of these unusual win conditions. Be on the lookout for openings to use strategies involving alternate win conditions; such as decking your opponent out because they ran out of a key resource, or Knocking Out your opponent\u2019s only Pokemon.\n1) Analyze the opposing deck to figure out what the threats will be in both players\u2019 decks.\n2) Play out the matchup in your head: who will win if it enters a Prize trade, and how quickly will both decks get to the point where they can trade Prizes?\n\u2026 your deck will win in a Prize trade scenario, your strategy should be to enter a Prize trade and win it convincingly.\n\u2026 your deck will lose in a Prize trade scenario, your strategy should be to avoid a Prize trade either by disrupting your opponent or winning before a Prize trade begins.\n4) Continually reevaluate your strategy throughout the game. If it no longer works, go back to the first bullet.\nThat\u2019s all the advice I can give when it comes to the groundwork for figuring out your win condition. Pokemon is not an auto-pilot game. Every deck is vastly different from each other; each one plays out differently against different decks; and each deck has multiple different attackers, methods of powering them up, and combos they can pull off with them. From here on out, you have to use your own knowledge of the game and the decks both you and your opponent are using to figure out the best path to victory. Practice always helps here \u2014 it will become much clearer how to play out a matchup after you\u2019ve played it a few times.\nI really enjoyed writing this first article! I love helping players improve themselves, so hopefully what you\u2019ve learned from this article will stick with you throughout your Pokemon journey.

Im not that good at deck building since i only have some competitive tournament exp. Only did at least 2 Spokane Cities Tournaments between 2010 and 2014. Battle Road 2009-2013. Placed 16th to 8th in every Battle Road and 15th in 2 Cities Tourneys. But since then i have not been able to acquire what i need to do well in local tourneys. However, these help me in casual play which i find more enjoyable. I just don't have the means to go to any of the championship tournaments. I find some of these new advisories most informative.\nBest article concerning Pokemon I have ever read. The small checklist at the end was a very helpful takeaway to remember while playing the game. Thank you for making it free!\nThank you for the compliment! I'm glad you got a lot out of it.\nThank you for this article! It is a gem for everyone trying to up their game and for those who just need a refresher on strategies.\nClearly everyone has their styles. For instance, I like early and abundant pressure on my opponents. But occasionally I have to keep it fresh with decks that deny my opponents of resources.\nAnd that is what's great about Pokemon! It changes consistently enough for metas to come and go.\nIs Lost March still competitive?\nBest partners for Greninja Gx?\nSam VerNooy has been playing the Pokemon TCG since he was three years old when his two older siblings introduced him to the Pokemon franchise.

{"text":"In 1999, a 60,000 square-foot helicopter guidance chip manufacturing facility was being transformed into a manufacturing plant for antenna and line support products along with enterprising co-location mounting frames.\nCLICK TO TWEET: Guest blog author Craig Lekutis highlights what a difference a couple of decades make in the wireless industry.\nThree years earlier in 1996, the National Association of Tower Erectors (NATE) held its first conference with a respectable 223 participants who were determined to elevate the safety of wireless infrastructure workers.\nLast month in Texas, CommScope and NATE proudly displayed what a difference a couple of decades can make. On my way to CommScope\u2019s sprawling 11-acre facility in Euless, Tex. to take part in a tour that was being held so that FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr could learn of the exacting ISO standards, technology and production equipment that is required to produce the street furniture and other structures necessary to roll out 5G, I recalled my first visit almost two decades earlier.\nAt that time, Plant Site Manager Kevin Paswalk was directing the ambitious expansion of the facility to meet the growing demand for co-location products and customer integration fulfillment needs. For someone who had never been in a manufacturing plant, it was truly interesting to see how workers in five welding booths, one saw operator and a turret punch and break press operator could turn out precision products so quickly.\nAlmost 20 years later, that interest turned into amazement as I witnessed the technological advances at the CommScope facility. Four work cells with robotic welders, laser cutters and other equipment were humming along with loud rhythmic sounds made by seemingly endless break presses and punch equipment within the plant\u2019s 250,000 square feet under roof.\nCommissioner Carr was also taken in by the expansive facilities that started with 30 employees during a single shift to over 180 employees today that are required for the 24\/7 operation. He said that CommScope was playing a critical role in making the transition to 5G and assisting the nation to be able to enjoy the economic benefits and opportunities that 5G will provide. During the tour, Paswalk, who is still enjoying the challenges of continuing to expand the plant, said the facility currently processes close to 1.8 million pounds of steel a month.\nLater that evening, Commissioner Carr was a keynote speaker at NATE UNITE 2019 in Grapevine which saw a record number of attendees. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was also a keynote speaker at the event that has become the premiere wireless infrastructure show.\nI recall the first conference in 1996 in Orlando that saw an impressive attendance of over 200 people and approximately a dozen exhibitors standing behind folding tables in a hallway as they distributed mostly dog-eared black and white brochures. Like CommScope\u2019s remarkable transition, NATE\u2019s event dwarfed its first Orlando conference with over 2,000 attendees and a packed exhibit hall with approximately 130 exhibitors, representing a who\u2019s who in the industry on the service and supply-side chain."}

{"text":"The Greenstock range of long life incandescent lamps are guaranteed to last up to 16 times longer than standard incandescent lamps whilst providing an alternative to low-energy fluorescent light bulbs.\nThe long life range provides an environmentally friendly alternative to other lamp types by reducing manufacturing and waste disposal through fewer lamp replacements. Ecological benefits also develop through the more efficient use of raw materials and energy during the manufacturing and recycling of the light sources, in addition to the reduction of packaging materials used. The time and disruption caused by changing lamps is also significantly reduced, as lamps need replacing less frequently, saving financial costs to organisations.\nThe long life of the bulbs is achieved by using the highest grade non sag tungsten with multiple supports for filament protection and chemical compounds inside the bulb to eliminate the impurities which cause filament failure. Brass caps are used to prevent sticking when the lamps are in light sockets for an extensive period of time.\nAll bulbs in the range have excellent colour rendition and high quality light output and can be used within dimming lighting systems.

{"text":"Drug Class: Lomotil > Diphenoxylate And Atropine > Diphenoxylate Hydrochloride > Diphenoxylate > Fully Synthetic Opioid > Opioids > Opioid Agonist > Analgesic.\nPhysicians prescribe Lomotil to treat diarrhea.\nG.D. Searle LLC Division of Pfizer Inc. distributes Lomotil in a cherry-flavored liquid and tablet form, both for oral administration. Each tablet and 5 ml dose of Lomotil contains 2.5 mg of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and 0.025 mg of atropine.\nThe recommended initial dose for adults is two Lomotil tablets or two 10 ml teaspoonfuls four times each day for a total of 20 mg of Lomotil per day. Most patients require this dose until they gain control over diarrhea, usually after using Lomotil for 48 hours; consumers can then reduce daily doses to meet individual needs. Frequently, patients can control diarrhea with as little as two tablets or two teaspoonfuls each day.\nPatients who do not experience relief from diarrhea after ten days of Lomotil therapy should consider an alternate form of treatment, as continuing Lomotil therapy further is unlikely to improve results.\nLomotil is not for children younger than two years old; pediatricians should prescribe Lomotil with caution to young children. Prescribers should consider the child\u2019s nutritional status and assess his level of dehydration caused by diarrhea.\nChildren under the age of 13 years should use Lomotil liquid rather than Lomotil tablets. Administrators should use the plastic dropper provided when giving Lomotil liquid to children to ensure accurate dosing.\nPediatricians will calculate initial doses of Lomotil according to the child\u2019s body weight. The recommended initial daily dose is 0.3 to 0.4 mg of Lomotil for every kilogram of body weight, given in four equal doses throughout the day. For example, a 5-year old weighing 35 lbs would receive 2.5 ml of Lomotil four times each day. Pediatricians may decrease this dose in children who are not eating well and who are suffering dehydration.\nPediatricians should decrease Lomotil dosages as soon as diarrhea begins to slow, prescribing maintenance doses as low as one-quarter of the initial daily dose. If Lomotil therapy does not slow diarrhea in 48 hours, the pediatrician should consider another course of treatment.\nDiphenoxylate hydrochloride slows intestinal contractions that propel food through the digestive tract, giving the body enough time to absorb excess water from stool. Lomotil reaches peak effectiveness about two hours after the patient consumes it. The liver metabolizes diphenoxylate before the body eliminates it in urine and feces.\nAtropine is an anticholinergic drug that, when consumed in high doses, causes severe weakness and nausea. Atropine acts as a deterrent to Lomotil abuse.\nLomotil is not a harmless medication; consumers should strictly adhere to dosage recommendations, especially when administering Lomotil to a child. Lomotil is not appropriate for children under the age of two years.\nYoung children are predisposed to suffering from delayed onset of diphenoxylate overdose. Furthermore, young children display widely varying responses to the effects of Lomotil.\nKeep Lomotil out of the reach of children. Overdose in children may result in respiratory depression and coma, potentially leading to brain damage or death.\nRespiratory depression is a dangerous, sometimes fatal breathing condition where the brain loses the urge to breathe. During respiratory depression, the lungs do a poor job of exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide and other gases, resulting in oxygen starvation and high levels of carbon dioxide. Symptoms of respiratory depression include slow, shallow breathing, irregular breathing patterns and a blue color around the eyes, lips and fingertips. High doses of Lomotil increase the risk for respiratory depression.\nOutpatient Lomotil consumers should drink plenty of liquids to maintain fluid and electrolyte balances; inpatients may receive intravenous fluids and electrolyte therapy. In cases of severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance, consumers should not take Lomotil until he has taken steps to correct these imbalances.\nLomotil slows intestinal contractions to allow the body more time to absorb excess fluids; this inhibition of movement through the digestive tract may result in fluid retention in the intestine in a way that further aggravates dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.\nDrugs that slow intestinal movements, including Lomotil, may prolong or worsen diarrhea associated with some types of bacterial infections or with the use of some types of antibiotics. Patients suffering from these conditions should not use Lomotil.\nLomotil use may cause the dangerous gastrointestinal crisis, toxic megacolon, in some patients with acute ulcerative colitis. Prescribing physicians should monitor these consumers closely, discontinuing Lomotil promptly if the patient experiences abdominal distention or other symptoms of toxic megacolon.\nPatients with liver or kidney disease should use Lomotil with extreme caution; the patient may become comatose if the liver cannot clear Lomotil from the body.\nThe diphenoxylate hydrochloride in Lomotil may enhance the effects of certain drugs including barbiturates, tranquilizers and alcohol. Prescribing physicians should closely monitor patients who use these substances while taking Lomotil.\nLomotil may cause the consumer to feel dizzy or drowsy; he should not engage in activities that require mental alertness, including driving a motor vehicle or operating heavy machinery. Using Lomotil with other substances, including alcohol, barbiturates and tranquilizers, can enhance their effects.\nEven therapeutic doses of Lomotil can cause signs of atropine overdose in children, especially in patients with Down\u2019s syndrome.\nLomotil is not appropriate for all patients. Those with a known hypersensitivity of diphenoxylate, atropine, or any other ingredient in Lomotil should not use this product. Individuals suffering yellow skin and eyes due to an obstruction of the flow of bile, a condition known as obstructive jaundice, should not use Lomotil. Patients suffering from diarrhea caused antibiotic use or by certain types of bacterial infections, should not use this product.\nLomotil is an FDA Pregnancy Category C, meaning research has not yet determined the effects of Lomotil on a woman or her unborn child. Pregnant women should only use Lomotil when the benefits to her health clearly outweigh the potential risk to the fetus.\nNursing mothers should use Lomotil with care, as some metabolites and components of Lomotil passes into breast milk and onto a breastfeeding child.\nLomotil interacts with some substances in unsafe or unfavorable ways, including barbiturates, tranquilizers and alcohol. Lomotil may interact with MAO inhibitors. Lomotil may slow the rate at which the body eliminates some drugs.\nEven at therapeutic doses, Lomotil may cause side effects in some consumers. Lomotil may interact with the nervous system to cause effects such as numbness in the hands and feet, lethargy, euphoria and depression. Other nervous system effects include confusion, sedation or drowsiness, dizziness, restlessness and headache.\nLomotil may cause side effects in the digestive system, including loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea and vomiting. Serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions include toxic megacolon, pancreatitis and the intestinal blockage, paralytic ileus.\nThe atropine sulfate in Lomotil may cause specific side effects, especially in children, including high body temperature, fast heartbeat, urinary retention, flushing and dryness of the skin and mucous membranes.\nAnyone can suffer an adverse allergic reaction to Lomotil or suffer anaphylaxis, a serious form of an allergic reaction. Symptoms of an adverse allergic reaction to Lomotil include swelling under the skin, itching, hives and swelling of the gums.\nLomotil overdose is a serious and potentially fatal crisis. Pediatric overdose may result in severe or sometimes fatal respiratory depression. Suspected victims of Lomotil overdose seek immediate treatment from the nearest medical facility.\nEarly signs of Lomotil overdose may include dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, like those in the nose and mouth. Other early signs of overdose are large pupils, restlessness, flushing, high body temperature and fast heartbeat.\nLater signs of Lomotil overdose include lethargy or coma, poor reflexes, fast and uncontrolled eye movements, pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression. Signs of respiratory depression may appear as late as 30 hours after ingestion. Respiratory depression may reappear after initially responding to treatment.\nEmergency department physicians and nurses consider all cases of Lomotil to be serious. Nurses will induce vomiting and pump excess Lomotil from the patient\u2019s stomach; they may then introduce a 100-gram slurry of activated charcoal into the conscious patient\u2019s stomach to absorb excess medication. Nurses will establish an airway to help the patient breathe or place him on a ventilator to allow a machine to breathe for him.\nPhysicians will prescribe 0.4 mg to 2 mg of naloxone hydrochloride to reverse the effects of respiratory depression in an adult patient; effects should be apparent within two minutes of naloxone injection. Lomotil injected under the skin or into a muscle will have delayed onset but provide longer-lasting results. The physicians may repeat naloxone every two to three minutes, administering up to 10 mg of naloxone.\nPhysicians calculate pediatric naloxone dosages according to the child\u2019s weight. The usual initial pediatric dose is 0.01 mg per kilogram of body weight, administered intravenously. If the child shows no sign of improvement, physicians may administer a subsequent dose of 0.1 mg\/kg of body weight.\nThe hospital will likely admit the patient for observation for at least 48 hours. The effects of respiratory depression outlast those of naloxone; signs of respiratory depression may reoccur even after the patient\u2019s condition improves. Supplemental doses of the longer-acting intramuscular dose of naloxone may provide better results during this time.\nAt therapeutic doses, Lomotil does not produce codeine-like euphoria - it takes very large doses of this produce to get someone high. Manufacturers add atropine to discourage abuse; doses of Lomotil large enough to cause euphoria make the consumer feel nauseated and weak. Because of this effect, Lomotil is a DEA schedule V narcotic, meaning it poses a very low relative potential for abuse.\nDiphenoxylate hydrochloride is related chemically to the opioid pain reliever, meperidine. As with meperidine, long-term use at high doses may cause physical dependence resulting in withdrawal symptoms when the individual stops using Lomotil.\nIt takes very large doses of Lomotil to produce dependence. Someone who takes 100 to 300 mg of Lomotil a day, which is the equivalent of 40 to 120 tablets, for 40 to 70 days will experience withdrawal symptoms when he stops using this product.\nMany institutions now offer detoxification services to help people overcome dependence on drugs like Lomotil. During detoxification, patients receive drugs to lower the levels of toxins along with medications to relieve withdrawal symptoms.\nRapid detox is humane and efficient approach to detoxification. During rapid detox, patients receive anesthesia and sedatives along with the standard detoxification and anti-withdrawal drugs. The rapid detox patient dozes in a comfortable \u201ctwilight sleep\u201d during the short detoxification process, unaware of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.\nKeep Lomotil in its original, tightly sealed container, out of the reach of children.\nLomotil is available in the United States only with a prescription."}

{"text":"In many ways, it\u2019s a science success story: an 8-year-old boy with a rare form of brain cancer is treated by one of the world\u2019s leading experts in the disease, who collaborates with a pioneering precision medicine institute to sequence his tumor and create a first-of-its-kind \u201corganoid\u201d replica in the lab, allowing for further analysis and treatment testing without risk of harm to the child.\nUpon analysis, the physician-scientist discovers a mutation previously not known to be linked to that type of cancer \u2014 and it happens to be in the protein that his colleague has spent a career studying. He contacts the colleague to ask if there is a drug to target the protein, and it arrives the next day. Applied to the organoid, the drug effectively kills 80-90 percent of the diseased cells.\nIf only the story ended there. Unfortunately, although the drug has been approved by the FDA, it cannot be used on the young patient because it has never been tested in children, and the pharmaceutical company controlling the drug is not willing to take the risk.\nGreenfield, a neurosurgeon at Weill Cornell Medicine & NewYork-Presbyterian, shared the anecdote at a special event held at Weill Cornell Medicine on June 29, one of 270 across the United States convened by Vice-President Joe Biden in tandem with a national summit at Howard University in Washington, DC.\nNeurosurgeon Mark Souweidane, M.D., spoke about the importance of developing new forms of drug delivery and working with industry to be able to integrate research and technology into the operating room. \u201cThese are ways we can use novel non-invasive technologies that will put us as surgeons out of business, unfortunately, but will help heal the world,\u201d Kaplitt said.\nGail Roboz, M.D., director of the Weill Cornell Medicine Leukemia Program, described immunotherapy, and in particular the use of CAR-T cells as an emerging therapy.\nRamakrishna and Greenfield said we also need to put greater value on the role of physician-scientist, and that the time of all physicians should be better protected so that they spend less time on record-keeping and grant-writing, and more time in the lab and clinic. Tung added that other scientists working in the background \u2014 the chemists, computational biologists, and engineers creating some of the new tools that are enabling such progress \u2014 should also be supported.\nBiden joined the event briefly via a conference call in which he urged participants to \u201cpush the boundaries of what is possible\u201d & work collaboratively to make it happen.\nLewis Cantley, Ph.D., director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, and event host Philip Stieg, Ph.D., M.D., director of the Weill Cornell Brain and Spine Center echoed this sentiment in their remarks.\nHimisha Beltran, M.D., a genitourinary oncologist & member of the Englander Institute, said the challenge is often being able to apply the information gathered from these data points into treatments. Sometimes scientists identify molecular mutations, but there are no known drugs to treat it or, as in Greenfield\u2019s example, the patient cannot access them. Another gap is in sharing this data, within the hospital network and on a larger scale that would benefit doctors elsewhere, as well as patients who might not have access to large academic medical centers.\nDavid Nanus, M.D., chief of the Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology & director of the NewYork-Presbyterian\u2013Weill Cornell Medicine Healthcare Services Cancer Program, agreed."}
{"text":"Abstract: A transmitter system including: a bidirectional signaling (BDS) network having first and second networks for carrying first and second carrier signals, and having a set of n phase synchronous location pairs (ai, bi); and also including tunable transmitter circuits for driving an antenna array, each tunable transmitter circuit having an output line for carrying an output signal and first and second input lines electrically connected to the first and second networks of the BDS network at locations of a corresponding one of the set of phase synchronous location pairs, and including a multiplier having a first input electrically connected to the first input line of that tunable transmitter circuit; a phase setting circuit electrically connected to the multiplier for controlling the phase of the output signal of that tunable transmitter circuit; and an amplitude setting circuit for controlling the amplitude of the output signal of that tunable transmitter circuit.\nAssignee: Blue Danube Labs, Inc.\nAbstract: Disclosed are a semiconductor integrated circuit device and a wireless communication system that are capable of improving reception sensitivity. The wireless communication system includes, for instance, a first duplexer, a second duplexer, a first low-noise amplifier circuit, and a second low-noise amplifier circuit. A transmission band compliant with a communication standard is split into two segments for use, namely, low- and high-frequency transmission bands. A reception band compliant with the communication standard is split into two segments for use, namely, low- and high-frequency reception bands. The first duplexer uses the low-frequency transmission band and low-frequency reception band as passbands. The second duplexer uses the high-frequency transmission band and high-frequency reception band as passbands.\nAbstract: Provided are a first filter 63a and a second filter 63b each having a pass band in the range of a frequency band that is obtained by, for example, substantially bisecting a frequency band of f1 to f4. In that case, the regions of the first filter 63a and the second filter 63b partially overlap with each other with the center frequency f5 interposed therebetween. In practice, even if the division is not bisection, a configuration is adopted in which a frequency region of the wider band (the first frequency band 61a) closer to a second frequency band 61b side is covered by the second filter 63b. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress the influence of load fluctuation in a multiband-compatible radio communication device.\nAbstract: A control loop circuit for use in a closed-loop control system that controls a system such as a linear motor is presented. The control loop circuit includes a lead-lag compensator that features a lead compensation network configured to reduce output noise without substantially changing the effect of the lead compensation in the control system's frequency response.\nAbstract: A high-speed CMOS transmit\/receive antenna switch includes a first transistor, a second transistor and a parasitic compensation network. The first transistor is operably coupled to an antenna, to a transmit path, and to receive a transmit\/receive (T\/R) control signal. The second transistor is operably coupled to the antenna, the receive path, and to receive the T\/R control signal. When the T\/R control signal is in a first state, the first transistor is active and the second transistor is inactive such that the transmit path is coupled to the antenna. When the T\/R control signal is in a second state, the second transistor is active and the first transistor is inactive such that the receive path is coupled to the antenna. The parasitic compensation network is coupled to compensate for adverse effects of parasitic components of the first and second transistors at operating frequencies of the transmit\/receive antenna switch.\nAbstract: A radio frequency (RF) switching power amplifier comprises: a switching amplifier 203 to provide an amplified signal within an RF band; and a delta signal modulator (DSM) 207 that is operable; to control the switching amplifier in a feedback configuration, to process an input signal within an intermediate frequency (IF) band where the input signal corresponds to a base band signal and the amplified signal, and to provide an output signal within the RF band to drive the switching amplifier. Certain embodiments allow for or compensate for a floating or variable IF band and multiple RF bands.\nAbstract: A dual band filter network for a radio communication apparatus is provided. The network has an antenna (212) for receiving and transmitting signals from a first frequency band and a second frequency band. The network has a first duplex pair (202) including a first transmit filter (204) including a first passband and stopband. The first duplex pair (202) also includes a second receive filter (206). The first filter (204) presents a consistent phase in the second passband due to the wide frequency separation between the first filter (204) and the second filter (206). The network has a second duplex pair (202') with similar characteristics as the first duplex pair (202). The network also has a switching circuitry (210) controlled by a switch control voltage (214) for selecting the appropriate filter circuitry. The network can be provided in a small sized, low cost package that also offers improved insertion loss performance.\nAbstract: An enhanced pole quality factor (Q) notch filter section circuit includes an active biquadratic notch filter section and a pole quality factor enhancement amplifier responsive to the output of the biquadratic notch filter section for providing at the input of the biquadratic notch filter section negative feedback in pass and stop bands of frequencies and positive feedback in the transition range of frequencies between the pass and stop bands of frequencies."}

The 4-5pm session on Tuesday, by Joshua Davis hadn\u2019t looked very interesting, so John Davey kindly swapped it with the Monday one, and so I was able to leave early without missing anything important to me.

Neither was particularly informative to a software developer, but both were thought provoking.\nI\u2019ll end this post with a thought for you: do you know everything? If not then you ignorant.

{"text":"Factor analysis and cluster analysis both function as powerful multivariate statistic tools that assist the researchers to explore the homogeneity and relationships among variables or subjects (Gorman and Primavera, 2012). Yet they are distinctly different. Only if one understands one\u2019s driver for analysis, as well as the strengths and limits of the two methods, can the researcher choose the most appropriate tool to carry out the analysis for an ideal outcome. In order to gain further insights of these two specific methods, the author would firstly define the concepts.\nThe comparison between factor analysis and cluster analysis is about approaching a set of data from two different perspectives. Factor analysis, referring to Bryman and Cramer (2006), is a statistical approach that emphasises on analysing the interrelationship among a great number of quantitative variables and interpreting them in terms of their common underlying dimensions, which are hereby named factors. Bryman and Bell (2011), stresses that factor analysis should be seen as a data reduction and summarisation technique aiming to reduce the number of variables with which the researcher needs to deal to one of more manageable size. On the other hand, cluster, defined as group of similar objects. Correspondingly, cluster analysis or clustering, according to Gorman and Primavera (1983), is a multivariate technique that focuses on grouping objects base on the proximities and similarities in their attributes. Nevertheless, due to the fact that there are clustering process using variables as basis for classification, vice versa, factor analysis procedures using objects as basis of factoring (Krebs et al., 2000). Arguments are that cluster analysis ought not to be identified exclusively with the object oriented approach to the data matrix (ibid). Moreover, Castro (2002) also emphasises on the ambiguity regarding the notion of a \u201ccluster\u201d. In other words, there is no precise definition for \u201ccluster\u201d. Various cluster models as well as clustering algorithms have been developed as a consequence of this ambiguity. Namely, hierarchical and non hierarchical cluster analysis, agglomerative and divisive algorithm, sequential and parallel threshold method, as well as optimising procedure. They vary tremendously depending on the notion of a cluster (Gorman and Primavera, 1983). As in the aim of this article is to investigate drivers for the two distinct methods, which are factor and cluster analysis, the author will not further elaborate on details of cluster models and algorithms. To serve the purpose of this article, \u201cobjects\u201d will be referred to as \u201cresearch units\u201d in the following contexts. Being plotted geometrically, objects within a specific cluster will appear to be close to each other whilst the distance between different clusters will be further apart on the premise that the classification is done successfully (Stamatis, 2003).\nAs mentioned in previous contexts, one can hardly choose the most appropriate tool to carry out the analysis without understanding the drivers behind certain analysis. Aiming to investigate drivers for the two distinct methods, the author decided to demonstrate the purpose and goal underlying each of the methods. Despite the explicit differences, both techniques, or procedures share same underlying logic, which is classification that is built on homogeneity (Krebs et al., 2000). As a result of their distinctive fundamental basis, cluster analysis and factor analysis yield different information about the data. While factor analysis emphasises on grouping variables, cluster analysis, on the contrary, concentrates on classification of research units based on homogeneity of their similarity on variables. It emphasis on the homogeneity and heterogeneity within the research units (Chambliss and Shutt, 2015). Videlicet, procedure of cluster analysis is based on proximity whilst factor analysis is based on correlation.\nIn respect to the purposes and objectives of these two techniques. Despite of the fact that both can be utilised as useful tools for data reduction and segmentation , factor analysis aims to reduce the number of variables and identifying the underlying interrelationship between variables and sometimes unobservable or latent construct in a set of data (Rogerson, 2001). It is widely utilised for theory development as it \u201cimplies the aspiration of establishing a theoretically based causal relationship between indicators (items) and a latent variable (the factor or dimension)\u201d (Gorman and Primavera, 1983), especially in fields as marketing, genomics, and social sciences researches (Howitt and Cramer, 2014). On the other hand, besides data simplification, cluster analysis\u2019s overarching goals are taxonomy description and relationship identification. Furthermore, utilisation of cluster analysis can be extremely efficient when reachers wish to develop hypotheses concerning the nature of the data or to test and examine previously developed hypotheses (Chambliss and Shutt, 2015). To give an example, if a hotel company believes that their customers are segmented into two group in regards to the comfort of the room and room price per night. Cluster analysis would then be able to classify the costumers who prefers comfort over price verses price over comfort. The resulting clusters, if any, can be portrayed for demographic similarities and differences. Common criticism of cluster analysis is that cluster structure will always be implied on a set of data even if the well separated cluster is unwarranted (Gorman and Primavera, 1983; Saunders et al., 2009; Clark et al., 2010). As for factor analysis, limitation is that, researchers have no other choice but to make vital decisions about factor rotation strategy as premises, which will strongly affect the eventual outcome (Gorman and Primavera, 1983).\nIn summary, choices of techniques is high relevant to researchers\u2019 intention. Depending on purposes of researches, Bacher (1996, cited Rogerson, 2001) suggests researcher to employ cluster analysis when aiming to classify entities and to exploit factor analysis when aiming to gain insights of underlying correlation of the variables (Sangren, 1999). Nonetheless, Gorman and Primavera (1983) proposed that these two techniques are not exclusive to one another. Comparison between factor analysis and cluster analysis can approach a data set from two complementary perspectives. Referring to one of ht most widely utilised software for statistical analyst, SPSS, factor analysis and cluster analysis can be used in a complementary fashion which will lead to enhancements of the interpretation of results found using each technique individually.\nStamatis, D.

{"text":"When I first saw these Reindeer Cookies on Pinterest, I knew I had to make them this holiday season.\nAnd luckily my mom had a cookie swap a couple weeks ago so it was the perfect opportunity. I couldn\u2019t find mini M&M\u2019s at my local supermarket so I decided to use chocolate chips for the eyes instead.\nThese are actually very easy to make \u2013 I used a basic peanut butter cookie recipe and then rolled them into one inch balls like you normally would do. Then you pinch the bottom of the ball, place it on the cookie sheet, and gently flatten the entire cookie so you end up with an upside down triangle shape. I did one batch first to see how they would bake and I was happy with the shape so I continued the process for the rest of the batch. Though, comparing the inspiration cookies to mine, I may try to make them puffier next time and I\u2019m not sure if I would make them as long.\nAs soon as they come out of the oven, you want to immediately stick on the pretzel ears, then the eyes (don\u2019t press down too much or else the chips will melt), and then the red M&M nose. So cute and this would be great to do with kids.\nAnd now I know why I gained 2 pounds in a week\u2026ohhhh Christmas cookies!"}

{"text":"A Rhode Island Superior Court jury found in our favor and against GEICO for our clients\u2019 2014 car crash.\nWe represented a husband and wife who were on their way to Wrentham shopping outlets on a sunny summer day in August 2014 when they were rear-ended on 95 North near the Thurbers Avenue exit. They were rear-ended by a NY attorney who was on his way to vacation in Cape Cod and who admitted he became distracted by some loud ATV\u2019s passing southbound, causing him to take his eyes off the road and strike the rear of our clients\u2019 vehicle.\nOn impact, both clients struck their heads on their respective headrests and developed neck pain as that Sunday progressed. They together presented to the hospital the next day where they were both evaluated and x-rays completed. They were each diagnosed with neck sprain and strain.\nTheir conditions worsened, and as a result, they both followed-up with conservative chiropractic treatment over a period of three months, which is typical for these types of injuries.\nUpon our clients\u2019 discharge, pre-suit claims were presented to GEICO who refused to settle, despite admitting their insured was at fault, based on an ill-suited claim that because there was low property damage, our clients could not have been injured.\nInsurance companies often attempt to make this argument to avoid compensating legitimately injured people. But, there is no scientific basis for the insurance company\u2019s argument as there are many factors to consider in a rear-end collision including head position of the injured person, the vehicle itself, objective findings of injury, and the transfer of force. When you think about it, if you hold a glass of water, and someone comes up behind you and pushes you, you are likely going to get wet. In a similar way, regardless of what happens to a car\u2019s bumper in a rear-end crash, the force of the impact may still injure the occupants.\nBecause GEICO refused to pay, we filed a lawsuit in Providence County Superior Court and proceeded through the steps of the lawsuit. Eventually, an arbitrator returned awards for our clients, which GEICO still refused to pay, essentially forcing us to take the case to a jury trial.\nIt took four years for our clients to get their day in court, but they finally did in early March. They were both cross-examined by GEICO\u2019s attorney, and the defendant, a NY resident, elected not to attend the trial. Our client\u2019s treating chiropractor was tendered as an expert, and he taught the jury about neck injuries resulting from rear-end crashes.\nAt the end of the two day trial, a jury of eight (8) returned a unanimous verdict against GEICO and in favor of each of our clients. Together with interest and costs, they were awarded over $20,000.00."}

It will begin with an introspective, intuitive and thoughtful perspectives into what I've been thinking about lately in regards to certain technologies, scientific advancements and more. Discussion of art will be second, followed by a thematic-discussion of the whole video in relation to understanding certain pieces of language i.e. specific words. The final segment will be a live reading of a manga\/fiction book that i really enjoy, with some introspective thoughts about the plot\/characters and ideas represented in the book. Manga wise i think i'm going to start with Blame! and then Five Star Stories. Fiction wise i'll start with Dune and then possibly Eon & Eternity.\nI feel strongly about how this video series will go as it encompasses a lot of what i already spend time on and will involve some adult-swim-esque bumps and some general cool-weirdness and surreal funk. If this interests you at all or you have suggests on content or want to ask me any kind of question dont hesitate to message me. I may open a discord and will invite people from time to time, in-case you're someone who desires such contact :) My stream will mostly be live EST time around 9-10 pm hopefully, though it will be subject to change.\nCatch you on the flip side, space cowboy."}
{"text":"Last weekend I finally read The Shining, and today I re-watched Stanley Kubrick\u2019s movie of the same name. I phrase it that way because I now realize how loosely the movie is actually based on the book. Stephen King\u2019s original is way better, worth the read, and will probably ruin the movie for you.\nReading and watching The Shining made me think of a visit to a museum in the 4th grade that gifted me the knowledge of exactly how to escape any and every maze ever made. Not that Jack Torrance from The Shining was in the right mind to use such a tip, but if he had read this post it would have saved his life. Speaking of which, any ax wielding psychos reading this post can bounce, I\u2019d like to preserve my ability to lose you in a maze.\nSo, how do you escape a maze?\nStep 2. Put said hand on it\u2019s corresponding wall (left hand on the left wall, or right hand on the right wall).\nStep 3. Walk forward keeping your hand on the wall no matter what. Follow all necessary turns and loop through any dead-ends.\nAs long as you\u2019re moving forward and you keep you hand on the wall you\u2019ll eventually find your way out. This method works no matter where you start it in the maze, but it may take a frustratingly long time to get out. Just stick with it, this method will make sure that you don\u2019t get lost and you don\u2019t go down the same path twice.\nPrev Resistance Recruiting me is futile."}

{"text":"In Financial Distraction Dr Steven Enticott delivers the recipe for financial freedom and independence. As Steve says, he has written the book as a work of love \u2013 coupling his unbridled optimism with a big dose of care and attention to the details that can radically help (or hinder, if they are ignored) everyday Australians. Having known and engaged professionally with Steve for over a decade, it\u2019s unsurprising that he combines this passion and care for the individual, along with the precision of a dedicated tax and accounting professional. The word \u201clove\u201d is one that Steve uses a lot \u2013 and he really means it!\nWhen I first heard that Steve was writing this book, it struck me that Australia is ready for this type of \u201cself-help\u201d manual. Where once we lived in an uncomplicated and growing country with unbounded opportunity and appropriate time for leisure, we are now faced with complexity most everywhere we look. We work longer hours than ever before, striving to get ahead quicker and better than our parents did. We place our financial faith in owning our own home, and rapidly accumulate levels of debt that our parents would never have dreamed of. Most of us have the benefit of compulsory superannuation \u2013 but the modest returns that are typical from mainstream superannuation providers (coupled with the disgrace that was the GFC) means that personal financial freedom is something that may be a long way off for many of us. And as Steve highlights, adversity like divorce, ill health and the \u201chard yards\u201d that are typical for most of us in small business, can make it really hard to get ahead in life.\nThe big difference in Financial Distraction is that Steve writes from the perspective of years of practical experience \u2013 formed with his passion for knowledge and higher learning and with Steve\u2019s love of humankind clearly in evidence on every page. How many suburban accountants do you know that have a PhD? (And a PhD focusing on financial derivatives, to boot!) So when Steve sets outs his recipe for overcoming the financial distractions that prevent so many of us from living a life of financial freedom, he clearly does so with technical credibility and accuracy.\nThat\u2019s something that deserves a little more comment. For most Australians, the first step they take towards financial freedom leads to a trip to the local financial planner or accountant. As Steve says in his book, there are many caring and literate financial planners and accountants in Australia. In my experience as a trainer and consultant to the financial planning industry, I can certainly attest to that \u2013 and may your search for an adviser lead you to one of the \u201cgood guys.\u201d Armed with Financial Distraction as your guide, you may well find a good adviser (or do it yourself) \u2013 but beware of the pitfalls that surround the typical financial adviser or accountant.\nThe problem is that the major institutions that own most financial advisory firms, and the researchers and \u201casset consultants\u201d that are the backbone of the independent boutique financial advisory businesses, live in a textbook world that is almost completely out of synch with our modern reality. Investment returns are measured by these \u201cprofessionals\u201d in what are cryptically referenced against \u201crolling 7-year periods\u201d \u2013 a way of looking at average returns over a very long period of time. Large wholesale investment management systems are \u201cblind\u201d to the specific needs and aspirations of individuals \u2013 so they justify their existence based on how their returns compare to long-term averages.\nThe irrelevance of the traditional approach was highlighted by the GFC \u2013 where even the world\u2019s best \u201cdiversified\u201d portfolios (ie, professionally designed and constructed according to the rules of the \u201crolling 7-year returns\u201d approach) fell by up to 50%. Five years later, most of these professionally designed portfolios are still way below their pre-GFC values.\nA minority of professional investment managers and financial advisers have re-booted to try to overcome these problems, but for most it\u2019s business as usual. The problem has started to become publicized and politicized, with ex\u2011Treasury Secretary Ken Henry making public his criticism of the traditional approach in 2012,when he highlighted the problem he calls \u201csequencing risk.\u201d What he means by that slogan is how bad\/damaging a severe fall in asset prices can be to someone who is about to (or has) retired. Traditionally constructed portfolios \u2013 like the ones that typical financial advisers will prepare for you \u2013 assume that an investor can achieve \u201caverage\u201d returns if they invest for a long enough period of time. Sequencing risk points out that a big market fall late in life will be very hard to overcome \u2013 there just isn\u2019t enough time or income to allow the portfolio value to rise to the level needed for a suitable retirement.\nYou won\u2019t find acknowledgment of these problems from a traditional financial adviser or accountant \u2013 and so it\u2019s vibrantly refreshing to read Financial Distraction \u2013 because Steve so candidly and openly shows you the tips and details of successful investing that he has accumulated over his professional life.\nFinancial Distraction highlights some of the usual methods for building financial prosperity \u2013 like starting early, sound budgeting, owning your own home, and utilizing superannuation \u2013 but then builds on Steve\u2019s \u201cThree Pillars\u201d approach to introduce the concepts of tax-effective investing. The chapters on \u201cgood debt\u201d and \u201cbad debt\u201d are crucial for all Australians to understand \u2013 and for any parent of young adults moving into the crosshairs of our major lending institutions, showing them these chapters on the problems that debt can cause will be an important game changer.\nFinancial Distraction then moves onto some seriously good analysis of the benefits and pitfalls of property and share investing. It introduces concepts like low cost Exchange Traded Funds, share portfolio protection \u2013 and the great power of the \u201clegal onshore tax haven\u201d which our Self Managed Super Fund (\u201cSMSF\u201d) provides. The chapters on investing are rounded out with easy to understand detail on farming in your SMSF, the use of trusts and estate planning ideas, and efficient structuring for small business owners.\nBeing grounded in the real world means that Steve also spends some time in his book, on the issues around financial recovery from divorce. If half of all marriages end up in divorce, this material must be highly relevant for many Australians.\nThrough all of Financial Distraction, Steve Enticott flavours his advice with the practical optimism that is his guiding philosophy: \u201cDo Something \u2013 NEVER Do Nothing.\u201d For any Australian looking for a practical, easy to understand guide to achieving financial freedom (and based on a technically highly accurate approach),Financial Distraction is a must read.\nFounder, ASX Listed Products Accreditation Course (\u201cLPAC Online\u201d).\n\"Do Something \u2013 NEVER DO NOTHING.\"\nFor any Australian looking for a practical, easy to understand guide to achieving financial freedom, Financial Distraction is a must read."}

{"text":"We're mesmerized by this glowing bike trail.\nFollow the blue brick road! It might not lead you to Oz, but this electrifying blue bike trail is still pretty magical.\nOn Sept. 23, the Polish town of Lidzbark Warminski brought a whole new vision and perspective to the traditional bike trail. This inventive bike path gives off a hypnotizing blue glow in the dark, thanks to a special kind of asphalt. The asphalt is composed of synthetic particles called \u201cluminophores,\u201d designed by the European engineering company TPA sp. z o.o. The luminophores absorb sunlight during the day, then transform the trail into the electric blue hue at night. TPA explained to the Polish newspaper Gazeta Olszty\u0144ska that the glow should last up to 10 hours.\nThe purpose of the glow isn\u2019t purely aesthetic though. The hope is that it will create safer conditions for nighttime cyclists and pedestrians.\nThe special section of trail is a new addition to a larger recreation path that leads up to a local lake. While the glow-in-the-dark path is only 328 feet long for now, the town hopes to expand the path after testing it out through the winter months.\nTo see more images of this incredible bike trail, check out the video below.\nHopefully it\u2019s only a matter of time before we start seeing trails like this here at home!"}

I have a mouse pointer that's all.\nALT-F2, ALT-SPACE do not work.\nOccasionally when I hit CTRL+ALT+BSPACE I see a KDE dialog flash up for a split second.\nFrom the looks of the .cache, .kde and .local folders being created KDE is actually running, but is not displaying anything.\nUsing xinit to launch firefox or chrome works perfectly, so the X11 display is functional.\nDoes not capture much of it. There are lots of errors about missing service entries and I have seen a segfault occasionally from ksmserver but that might be related to hard killing it with CTRL+ALT+BSpace.\nAny ideas on how to further diagnose?\nThis is my first systemd build, is there anything I might have forgotten to do that would prevent KDE accessing it's XSession correctly?\nI installed plasma with plasma-meta. Do I need to do kde-meta as well?\nSo I have worked at this for a few evenings. I've installed kde-meta which made no change.\nInvestigating further and KDE is actually running. It's just the display is black. For example if I xinit xterm, xterm appears. If I then run \"startkde\", the screen goes black, however the mouse pointer still turns to a text caret when I move it over where the xterm window was. I can click on it and CTRL+C startkde to kill it.\nI'm fairly baffled by this. There are lots of errors in the startkde startup output, but then, when is that something new?\nI'm still wondering if this is an issue with systemd and permissions. Everything except for KDE can present on the X11 display.\nI'll this a go when I get home, thanks.\nI also found that even starting \"kwin_x11\" produces the black screen. I was reading elsewhere that Plasma might be inadvertantly defaulting to Wayland for compositing which is not yet supported on NVidia cards due to wars going on between different parties and NVidia refusing to follow wayland as currently implemented. This opens the option to downgrade to a lower version of plasma which might fix this.\nSo I have a few leads.\nxfce4 works, for now. Which oddly seems to be using half of KDE anyway! I have Dolphin, my K menu and a bunch of other bits of KDE it seems.\nReally disappointed in KDE now. the internet is absolutely stuffed full of \"Black screen\" issues with, what seems like dozens of causes.\nI have also isolated the KDE issue to kwin. \"kwin_x11 --replace\" hides all the windows, leaves the xfce4 desktop background and then stays that way, so instead of black I just get what was the last background.\nkwin_wayland just segfaults, but that is expected with NVidia.\nI think I need to dig deeper into my OpenGL setup and make sure everything else is working."}

{"text":"i support shortening the T+3 settlement cycle to T+2. in fact, i think there should be nothing preventing trades from settling the same day as the trade occurred. we have an excessive amount of regulation because of shortselling. if securities were actually owned by the seller, then there would be much fewer regulations needed. buyers would be assured of owning their portfolio and brokers would only be an agent. brokers, in an effort to take possession of their customer's title, would not be able to sell order flow nor accept IOUs instead of their customer's property.\ni differ with the history in page 11 of this rule proposal. the cause of the \"paperwork crisis\" was that there was a failure to deliver the securities in a timely manner. this situation has not improved over time but now the clearinghouse and brokers accept IOUs instead of delivery of securities that have been sold short. and now the clearinghouse and brokers do not force a buy-in of securities that have been sold short.\n\"There are no general rules regarding how long a short sale can last before being closed out. A short sale is a transaction in which shares of a company are borrowed by an investor and sold on the market. The investor is required to return these shares to the lender at some point in the future. The lender of the shares has the ability to request that the shares be returned at any time, with minimal notice. In this event, the short sale investor is required to return the shares to the lender regardless of whether it causes the investor a gain or a loss on his or her trade.\nHowever, requests to return shares are rare, as the lender of the shares is a brokerage firm that has a large inventory of stock. The brokerage firm is providing a service to investors; if it were to call shares to be returned often, investors would be less likely to use that firm. Furthermore, brokerage firms benefit greatly from short sales through interest and commissions on the trades. And there is limited risk for the brokerage firms due to the restrictive margin rules on short sales.\"\nregarding page 21-22: \"Debits and credits in the participant\u2019s settlement account are netted intraday to calculate, at any time, a net debit balance or net credit balance, resulting in an end-of-day settlement obligation or right to receive payment.\"\nthe clearinghouse netting forces the investors\/long positions to fund the shortselling. instead, separate accounts should be maintained by the clearinghouse, reported publicly in aggregate for all trades in the clearinghouse. no transactions should be refused after one of the parties is in default, but instead should be bought in promptly according to market deadlines.\nIOUs should never be accorded the same bundle of rights as physical stock certificates because there is risk. risk is not zero. borrowed equities should also not be deemed as having the same bundle of rights because then 2 entities would own the same bundle of rights.\nthe problem with shortselling is that the clearinghouse, which is the agent for the member, is accepting an IOU in place of the securities. part of this difficulty is that the bookkeeping is recording the end of day price as equal to the security. shortselling is increasing the authorized shares of the security \"temporarily\", however by equating the amount to a dollar figure, the authorized shares may be temporarily increased by as many dollars as the shortseller wishes.\nworse, the regulator has allowed shortsellers to produce \"shares available to borrow but not borrow the shares\". i do not see how this is different than imaginary shares. if this shortselling was being bought in promptly, there would be no failure to deliver and not transactions would be kicked out of the clearinghouse to make private arrangements. further, margin would not be restored, once a trade was declined.\nwhich would be the appropriate method to verify title of securities? the auditor of the broker? the auditor of the clearinghouse? there should be no tolerance of error in determining title. title should be verified by the gross # of shares that all customers own in that member broker, not just the shares that one customer owns. which would be the appropriate method to handle counterfeit securities? currently, the clearinghouse can transfer counterfeit securities to a buying broker. i don't know if the customer's $ is given to the counterfeiter or held permanently by the clearinghouse. but i should not have securities in my account that cannot be sold again due to the fact that someone accepted counterfeit securities without my knowledge. the value of counterfeit securities is $0, so transfer of said securities would violate the principals of contract law.\nthe clearinghouse should produce the securities, in the event that false securities were transferred to a customer. the broker, as agent, and the clearinghouse, as agent of the broker, are liable to produce the broker's customer's property. the broker and the clearinghouse cannot decline this obligation. presently, both are able to decline, and the broker's customer must accept that they cannot sell property for which they paid cash. this is quite amazing to me.\ni disagree that long sales on page 70 should be allowed additional days. these are securities that are presumed to be on the account of the member broker and no additional days are necessary to effect such a sale.\nyou can see that there are several pages required to discuss shortselling rules and procedures. if shortselling was not allowed on the basis that only an IOU can be given at any point instead of transfer of title, that shortselling expands the stock float without authorization or notice to any market participant.\ninvestors\/buyers are not notified that they have only received an IOU, that they do not have their portfolios. yet, auditors are supposed to verify that all broker customers have their portfolios."}

{"text":"I must confess that although I love spirits, Gin is not at the top of my list when I reach the bar- however, after a recent trip to Carom @ Meza, I was persuaded by head bartender and gin enthusiast Adam Spinks to come back to the Soho bar for a gin masterclass and promised to change the way I thought about one of the world\u2019s oldest spirits.\nI arrive at Carom slightly apprehensive as many have tried to convert me to gin, but have failed miserably. I take my seat at the bar and all 6 of us in attendance are given a history of gin. This was certainly the most interesting history lesson I\u2019ve ever had (if only school history lessons were this good)- did you know that it got the nickname \u2018Mother\u2019s ruin\u2019 as parents were failing to feed their children in favour of getting intoxicated on cheap gin all day?\nWe were then introduced to Martin Miller\u2019s, a gin first distilled in 1999 as a result of the man himself being fed up of the lacklustre gins available and had the burning desire to create a gin using only the finest ingredients in the world. He started by purchasing a single copper still called Angela that has been distilling gin since 1898, and is the sole still used to create Martin Miller\u2019s. I will spare you the details of where each ingredient comes from, but they have literally gone all around the world sourcing the best juniper, cinnamon etc all in the name of creating great gin. And for the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance; once the product has been distilled in London, it is transported to Iceland so they can add some of the world\u2019s purest water, hence why the bottle bares an English and Icelandic flag.\nWe were then treated to a tasting of some delicious Martin Miller\u2019s based cocktails. My favourite . was the Gin Mojito, an interesting twist on the rum classic. Adam then dropped the bombshell that we would have to try our hand at making some cocktails of our own, with the winner receiving a bottle of Martin Miller\u2019s! After trying my hand at creating a orangey, icey, minty mess of a cocktail, I have a new found respect for bartenders, and needless to say I did not win (sad face).\nThanks to Carom @ Meza, I\u2019ve gone through my own gin renaissance. Martin Miller\u2019s may not win any awards for its green credentials, but the quality is undeniable and I highly recommend all lovers of the 11th century spirit to try a cocktail (or few) in one of Soho\u2019s best loved bars."}

{"text":"The first time I started a weight loss journey, I had the wrong mindset. And I gained all the weight back plus some extra pounds for good measure. But the exercise I started during that time stuck with me. Sort of.\nI just stopped applying exertion.\nThe first form of exercise I started was using the treadmill that had been in a corner of the family room for a couple of years collecting dust. It was all I could do to stay on that thing for 15 minutes at the whopping speed of 2.0 mph.\nOnce I could stay on the treadmill for 30 minutes at 3.5 mph, I decided I needed more and tried a gym for one month. When you combine the fact that I have the attention span of a two-year-old with the fact that 60+ year olds were putting me to shame on the treadmill, I thought better of the whole gym membership idea.\nNext, I gave up the treadmill altogether and started walking the dog outside. But, since this was more about the dog than me, I started on the DVD track. With Yoga Booty Ballet. OUCH. This lasted about one month. I got bored. End of DVD.\nAnd so I stopped doing everything. Except walking the dog. Which was NOT enough to keep the weight off. Especially since the eating of all sugars and carbs and anydamnthingIwanted had started again.\nIn the midst of this regain, our daughters gave us a Wii for Christmas and I started Wii Fit. Fun! At first. Then, bored again. So I got Wii Zumba. Fun! Until I got bored.\nNothing really changed until I joined a challenge in June 2011. When I finally discovered the exercise that I seem to be able to stick with.\nSimple. Effective. Inexpensive. It's hard to beat. AND, Tucker (my sweet doggie) goes with me every day! Which is great until he sees a squirrel and we have to stop while he barks at it.\nDo I get bored? Yes. But that's why I have several options-when I'm bored, I change it up. For example, I might walk a mile, run a mile, walk a mile OR I might run a song, walk a song, run a song...etc. Then there are days when I only walk- in which case I increase my distance.\nThe thing is, I started out not being able to walk faster than 2 mph for 15 minutes on a treadmill and I am now either walking 5 miles OR running\/walking 3 miles every single day. Rain or shine.\nSo, all that wordiness to say what?\nExercise is a must to getting fit.\nIt doesn't matter how little you are able to do when you first begin, you just have to start. It will get better.\nIf you get bored, CHANGE what you are doing- there are MILLIONS of options out there.\nYou might not be able to stay on a treadmill for more than 15 minutes at first but, if you stick with it, you'll be walking further and faster (OR running) before you know it!\nIf your choice of exercise requires shoes, make the investment in a good pair- I'm in love with my Asics!\nStick with it! Even on days when the spirit is NOT moving you, EXERCISE ANYWAY. You'll feel better. Afterwards.\nExercise can lead to weight loss, but it provides so much more- YOU WILL GET FIT!\nYou won't get fit if you keep making excuses about not exercising.\nDon't freak out about speed and distance to begin with- just move!\nI'm sure some of you have thought of even more benefits to getting fit than the few I've mentioned here.\nSo what are you waiting for? Researchresearchresearch your options! Readreadread everything you can get your hands on that will help you make an informed decision about the exercise that is right for you! Talktalktalk to a health care professional to make sure your choice is just right for you! Seriously, you really don't want to start something the wrong way or something that is wrong for you\/your current fitness\/health level and injure yourself.\nAnd then, GET UP and GET MOVING!\nThis is the sixth day of the A-Z April Challenge. I thought I might try a theme this year and focus on my personal journey to health and fitness, including weight loss.\nToday's letter is F and my word for the day is FITNESS.\nI don't actually need to lose weight myself, but I can so relate to this post on the whole fitness thing. You name it, I've done it. Usually getting all the equipment to go with it. It lasts for a few weeks and then my motivation flies right out of the window. Not good!! I had a Wii Fit the Christmas before last and, hey, this was going to be IT! Lots of my bloggy buddies were going to come on the journey with me. But I'm afraid that this too is now gatherine dust somewhere. I'm hopeless - I really am, but I am very conscious of the fact that as I shall be 65 next week, I really must try to keep as fit as I can, to keep up with my lovely grandchildren. If that's not an incentive, then I don't know what is. Wishing you and your lovely family a very Happy Easter, Pam.\nThis is a really great post! I think you just spoke what happens to a lot of people. I use to wake up and be at the gym by 7, go home and get ready for class at 9. Then I moved 20 minutes away from campus and I stopped. It really effects your energy levels.\nI look forward to reading the rest of your A to Z posts!\nAbsolutely! And I don't understand the whole gym thing with machines and sweaty bodies when one can be outside. I'm trying to visit all the A-Z Challenge Blogs this month.\nI love walking, with a little bit of running thrown in during the walk.\nMy other fitness thing is Mr Motivator dvd, I'm almost a year into it and not bored yet, but it has lots of different options, and all of them are set in open air in Jamaica, so I imagine I'm there every time I do it!!\nFitness is fun, you always feel better after taking exercise, even if it was done reluctantly!\nGreat motivational post! And now that spring is here, I can walk those dirt roads and trails. Anything is better than being on a treadmill in the house!\nAnd actually, there are times when stress makes us want to nibble, munch, etc. when what really seems to help the most is to exercise that stress away!\nHave a wonderful Resurrection Sunday Pam.\nGreat post! I'm putting it on my mirror.\nBlogged- Good for you cutting out the snacks! I like popcorn too- so I stopped buying it. LOL Now, let's get you moving!\nDiane- I'm glad I'm not the only one with a short exercise attention span. LOL Even something as simple as walking can help keep us fit!\nJennifer- You're right, it does affect energy levels! And it was not easy finding something to keep my attention span.\nShark- Outside is best for me! I thought I would try to visit all of them too- that's going to take some major effort!\nMimi- I like that too! I totally agree- I always feel better after I exercise so I make myself do it on the days I think I don't want to.\nJudy- I know you'll be glad to get out of the house and walk! But it's nice to have the treadmill when the weather gets bad. Thanks!\nJo-Thanks! I hope it helps!\nBINGO! You're so right about finding something that works for you. I do all kinds of exercising, but pretty much lately it's all about my exercise bike. I'll ride this for at least an hour each day. As we grow older it's more important than ever to keep moving to keep our metabolism reveed because when it slows down then that's when the trouble hits with unwanted pounds clinging and jiggling. Keep up with the moving!\nNo running for ma any more - my knees won't take it. But the walking is a happiness factor on those crap days.\nCathy- I tried a spin class and loved it! But my backside did NOT love it. :) True though- when we find our exercise niche, it's on!\nLucy- Absolutely! It takes a bit of time for some of us but it's so worth it!\nTracy- I have the opposite problem. I don't like being hot. When I'm hot, my mood gets hot too. LOL I haven't run a 5k yet, but I have a goal to try the Turkey Day run on Thanksgiving day!\nGreat post! There are soooo many exercise options! I love to try new DVDs and I love running a few miles (OK, running verryyyy slow interspersed w\/lots of walking) when it is HOT outside. There is an option for everyone!\nI stopped by after seeing you on the A to Z Challenge (which I'm taking part in too!) because my nest will be empty in just a few months. I'm listening to Pomp and Circumstance on YouTube every day to hopefully get most of the crying out of my system...it's a joy to see our kids go on to the next step in life but quite a change as well. I'll be stopping back!\nShelly- When it's hot outside (which we never got a break from this year because winter never showed up) it's so much harder for me. But I do it anyway. And I'm not dead yet. You can listen to that song all you want but the tears are going to come anyway! Just so you know. It's so bittersweet- the pride coupled with the missing them. We'll keep in touch!\nGrammy-There are so many things we can do that don't require as much exertion. And so many health options out there that can help with illness! It's never too late!\nEvery weight loss blog that I read that is \"on track\" with it says the same thing. Just do it. And then they say more. So, I think you are definitely onto something. Very proud of you for sticking with it. When I can feel confident about not falling down I am definitely going to get back on that horse, because I know you are right.\nI hope you keep spreading the message because the sight of human couch potatoes waddling about is pretty depressing for a jungle ape. Have you ever tried climbing trees? Great for the tush.\nI figure I have two choices: Hurt while exercising or Hurt while sitting on the sofa.\nMight as well get up and MOVE!\nI have become inspired now that spring is here to work out outside. I take my dumbbells outdoors and do a circuit training routine with timed bouts of jogging in the back yard interspersed with strength training exercises, either with the weights or on various \"stations\"... pull-ups on the clothes line pole, dips on perfectly situated tree limbs, etc. I love it.\nRobin-Thank you! It's a total mindset. Get back on the horse regardless. Every single day is a new start day. Every single day. And we take it one day at a time.\nGB- Bah hahahahaha! I'll give it a go in the Magnolia in the backyard!\nHuntress-Amen Sista! At least with the moving around part we start looking better and better!\nGreat advice! Keeping things interesting is very important in terms of continuing to exercise. Glad to hear you found something that keeps you going!"}
{"text":"To the outsider, tai chi must seem to be inordinately concerned with structure.\nA considerable amount of time and attention is placed upon alignment, body usage and awareness.\nOther martial arts spend significantly less time on these matters.\nYet, without optimal use of the body at all times, we cannot maximise our strength and reduce our weaknesses.\nYang Cheng Fu's 10 essentials and other guidelines teach us how to use our body.\nWhat they seldom teach is why.\nA student needs to attend a class which explores the Way in which the body works in combat and everyday life.\nIt is necessary to be scientific.\nTo find out for yourself what works and what does not.\nOur aim is to cultivate a loose, flexible network of body parts.\nIntegrated, flowing, smooth and responsive.\nNew starters cannot just drop a lifetime of bad habits.\nThey need to be gently steered towards understanding and change.\nBy recognising the validity of an integrated, relaxed framework, it is easier for a person to let-go of the past.\nIf you cannot use your own body in a balanced, natural, cohesive manner, how do you expect to defeat an opponent?\nMost people rely upon local muscle strength.\nTai chi is not about fighting.\nYou must remain calm, composed, relaxed.\nNot caught-up in the excitement and fear of combat.\nBy paying serious attention to your body, mind and emotions you can address your own concerns.\nOnce you are integrated, balanced and aware, you can consider manipulating an opponent.\nHaving gained a measure of structure in solo practice, the real test is partner work and combat training.\nYou may believe yourself to be relaxed and responsive.\nWorking with somebody else may prove otherwise.\nSensitivity is a difficult skill to master.\nIn truth, it can never be mastered because you can always improve it.\nUnless your body can be used in the appropriate way relative to an opponent, all of your training is for nothing.\nThe real challenge is to be soft.\nTo employ peng, jing, stickiness and grace.\nMany students possess a small smattering of abilities, but typically lack the capacity to consistently apply these skills.\nThe fault lies with structure.\nWithout a working, comfortable, familiar framework, your abilities will not work when you most need them.\nThe main means of training framework is 'form', and for most students form is a significant area of weakness.\nPartnered drills and qigong exercises supplement form and give you the opportunity to practice and test the validity of the tai chi body mechanics.\nWithout structure, you are vague, and incapable of having your abilities at your fingertips whenever you need them.\nIt is necessary to contain, to shape, to focus.\nThe body mechanics cultivated in qigong exercises are used throughout the form.\nAspects of the form are utilised in partnered drills designed to increase your capacity to apply the tai chi principles.\nEvery student needs to recognise the purpose of each drill and see how the skills extend into actual combat.\nThey teach habit patterns in the body: reflexes.\nYou must take the insights, tactics and body skills into a combat situation.\nOnly by doing this can you complete the circle and give meaning to the drill, and in turn the tai chi.\nIf your form adheres too rigidly to a primitive introductory shape, then you cannot reasonably use it in combat.\nThe 'square form' that beginners learn was designed to teach the outline, the pattern.\nIt does not teach any neigong.\nThere is no internal body work taking place at all.\nIt is necessary to learn how the body is working and how the power is being generated.\nEvery movement must be dismantled, understood, enhanced and applied.\nUnless you take the form much further, it cannot be used in combat. The structure must be dynamic, fluid, protean.\nEvery movement feels natural, comfortable and powerful.\nWishy-washy tai chi lacks the primal. It looks and feels insubstantial and weak.\nSuch practice cannot be used in actual combat.\nEven if the student is perfectly aligned, it is not enough.\nWithout feeling, without immersion in the event itself, the form remains poor.\nYou can see when a student imbue their form with shen. It looks quite different. Alive. Predatory. Applicable.\nThe danger facing many students is that their structure is incorrect.\nThere is a rigidity to it that essentially prevents freedom of movement.\nThis is not tai chi.\nA student must be nimble and responsive, sensitive and alert.\nClumsiness is simply not acceptable.\nYou must learn to feel.\nTo move freely and easily. To act. To project energy.\nThe key ingredient in structure is not the body.\nAligning the body is necessary, and helpful, but underlying the physical concerns is the mind.\nUnless you have clarity and focus, you cannot unite the body and use it.\nTo quote Yang Cheng Fu: \"Use mind, not force\"."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks tiny and done up like a French lounge to a greater extent.\nThe furniture is practical, isn\u2019t it?\nBut the atmosphere is welcoming, delivering a sensation of good feeling and the sense of delight, I guess.\nMoreover, you can also affix your own components in addition to the type of pizza\/pasta, right?\nIn the way that the pics you took optimistically demonstrate, the pastas aren\u2019t an exactly plentiful volume, are they?\nUnfortunately(?), you didn\u2019t order any pizzas there, they are thought to be prepared right and appear to the table in crisp, I imagine.\nThis restaurant really is a \u201chole in the wall.\u201d The location is still under the range of tourists but more than half of clientele are locals, I saw.

{"text":"The USA offers unrivalled opportunities to get out on the road and experience not one, but dozens of superb USA scenic drives. Whether you are a visitor to the States or a local, one of the best ways to get an in-depth look at the country is to undertake one of the amazing Great American road trips that are out there waiting for you. On this type of holiday the journey should be more important to you than the final destination, and when you start making your plans try to incorporate enough time to be able to disregard tight schedules and just follow your heart.\nIf you are doing the trip in a RV, Motorhome or Campervan rental, you are already at an advantage, and will have a lot more flexibility to just stop and enjoy that dramatic sunset or perfect little village. The length of the adventure will depend on the amount of time you have \u2013 try not to fit too much into one trip; it\u2019s no fun spending hours and hours on a highway and having no time to enjoy yourself along the way. Remember, it\u2019s all about the journey!\nClassic Route 66, which runs all the way from Chicago to Los Angeles, is almost an institution in America, a tour of discovery along a historic and vaguely kitschy part of the country where time has stood still. This is a great place to get off the highway, amble along at your own pace and enjoy the eclectic towns and attractions along the way, ending up in Flagstaff. From there you can continue along the Oak Creek Canyon Route to Sedona, where there are amazing outdoor activities to enjoy before continuing on your way to the Grand Canyon and then on to Las Vegas, for a major change of pace!\nThe West Coast offers the Pacific Highway, one of the most iconic Great American road trips for you to include in your itinerary. If you can, start in the far north, on the Pacific North West coast in Seattle, and make your way down the coast to Los Angeles at your own pace. Along this route you get to drive along the Oregon coast, visit Crater Lake, Redwood National Park, the wonderful Napa Valley \u2013 be sure to spend a few days here enjoying the vineyards and tranquillity \u2013 before reaching San Francisco.\nDrive across the Golden Gate Bridge and visit Alcatraz, before continuing on the most popular section of the trip, past Monterey, Santa Barbara and finally ending up in Los Angeles. This is a wonderful trip for the whole family, with a great number of excursions and activities available all along the way, and excellent RV campsites.\nFor a great coastal vacation drive the scenically magnificent Overseas Highway from Miami to Key West.

{"text":"A grass-roots, non-profit Political Action Campaign (PAC), located in the state of Oregon. Our purpose is to educate the public as to the ecological, spiritual, and commercial values of our forestlands, as well as ensuring that the legacy of our natural heritage is passed on to our children through the implementation of sustainable, non-destructive forest use policies.\nSustainable Forestry Network has a grassroots campaign underway to qualify the Oregon Forest Restoration Initiative for the November 2010 ballot. Using the State of Oregon's citizen initiative process, Sustainable Forestry Network must collect approximately 80,000 signatures of Oregon registered voters by July 1, 2010 to qualify for the ballot. Your help is needed in this effort to stop the devastating and unnecessary practice of clearcutting o\u00adn private and state forest lands throughout Oregon. Let's work together to protect the state's remaining 4% of old growth forests, and to stop hazardous chemical herbicide and pesticide use o\u00adn forest lands.\nThe Oregon Forest Restoration Initiative does not propose a ban o\u00adn logging. It is a carefully thought out proposal that requires that timber o\u00adn private and state forestlands be harvested by selective logging as an alternative to the current wasteful practices. It also protects and helps restore the remaining old growth stands in Oregon. Finally, the measure seeks to restore our soil, air, and water quality by requiring the use of safe, organically certified weed and pest control methods o\u00adn state and private forest lands in Oregon.\nOregon has an amazing diversity of forest ecosystems: from the coastal forests that cover the rocky cliffs that rise out of the Pacific Ocean and spread over the Coast Range mountains, through the fir, spruce, and hemlock forests dominating the Cascade Range, and across the mountains and high deserts of Eastern Oregon where Ponderosa pines tower in their majesty. These diverse ecosystems combine to create a wealth of wonder which has drawn so many of us to Oregon.\nOur work for forest conservation is far from over. Our best efforts are now most crucial. Everyone's help is needed! We hope this site will help folks understand how to best use your skills and energy for the protection of Oregon's land and wildlife.\nWe encourage you to join us in our efforts to protect and restore our forest ecosystems and create economic lifestyles that are in harmony with nature. Your help is needed, indeed crucial, for us to protect and restore the ecological health of our forests. Your support for this campaign will help to qualify and pass the Oregon Forest Restoration Initiative into law during the November elections and stop the destruction of clearcutting in Oregon!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to get a logo made for your company you want to know about pricing for logo design at top crowdsource contest websites. I will review and compare logo pricing packages for top sites 99designs, CrowdSpring and DesignCrowd.\nOne of the reasons I recommend 99 designs is their generous 100% money back guarantee \u2013 thus launching a logo design contest is risk-free.\nAnother reason that I recommend 99designs to start up companies is because of the high-quality logo designs for affordable prices.\nSee these professionally designed by 99designs.com logos for dental clinics, exercise fitness studio logos, and restaurants logos.\nOne aspect of the pricing packages that can be confusing is that although they have the same names bronze, silver, gold, and platinum, contests for other types of designs such as book covers, websites, clothing, t-shirts, social media etc have different price points.\nThese packages have fixed prices as opposed to 1-on-1 designer projects which are charged by the hour. Most entrepreneurs are best served with a fixed price contest to contain costs which can quickly go over budget with hourly fees.\nLogo design packages prices start at $299 Bronze for those who want a creative design on a budget. For greater variety, you could upgrade to the Silver package for $499 or to the Gold at $799, which works only with mid-2 top level, logo designers or go for the best Platinum package that is only top-level designers and includes prioritize support and a dedicated account manager.\nNote this package is for logo design only \u2013 if you are a new company a better value is the brand identity package which combines logo design, stationery and social media branding.\nFor logo design, the price difference between the gold ($499)and platinum ($1199) packages is $700.\nHere are the four questions to ask yourself to decide which upper price tiers packages of 99designs are best for you and worth the money in your particular situation.\nDo you have experience working with graphic designers, both communicating your desires and giving feedback? If you are inexperienced with how to work with designers the platinum package comes with a dedicated Account Manager who will work closely with you and manage your project to its successful conclusion.\nHow much variety and design quality do you need? The more expensive packages attract better designers and more of them, so you will get a wider breadth of logo idea submissions of a higher quality with gold and platinum packages vs the entry level bronze.\nWhat is your budget? If you are a lean startup then the bronze or gold package is the best for you. It offers a good combination of value with lower prices with good designers.\nDo you want many different designers submitting logo designs? To get the maximum number of 99 logos designers participating in your contest select the gold or platinum package and consider adding additional prizes. Artists look for these contests and will put the most effort into the designs they submit.\nThe site is a crowdsourcing site, which means that \u201cthe crowd\u201d, a million graphic artists from around the world, are your vendor source to create logos, website design, and app designs. The majority of clients choose to launch design contests to get the maximum number of logo ideas.\nOnce you submit your logo brief, which is easy and fun, within a day you will begin to get logo design ideas submitted for your consideration. First, you will create a shortlist of the best and send feedback to the artists so they can improve the logos to better suit your needs. Finally, you select your favorite design as your new logo.\nYou can also select a designer and work 1-on-1 instead of ordering a logo contest.\nCome along and watch this video playlist of my 99designs logo design process from ordering to final logo selection.\nCrowd spring offers different packaging prices starting at $299 for Silver, Gold for $499, and Platinum at $1199. Each package has slightly different options as shown in the screenshot below.\nThis site is difficult to use and the pricing structure is confusing. Instead of the clearly defined pricing packages of both 99 designs and Crowd Spring this company almost hides its prices. There is no pricing page, nor any detailed information that I could find. After searching for over 10 minutes.\nWhy are they hiding their pricing? This makes me very suspicious of the company that won\u2019t tell me their price before they want me to buy. Additionally, you cannot even begin to request pricing without supplying your email address so they can market to me directly. It feels a bit dishonest and more than a bit tricky.\nYour design budget \u2013 You state your desired budget, which starts at $150 for low-end logo designs.\nI hope that I have provided valuable business information for your logo purchasing decision."}
{"text":"So what better solutions do we have to this epidemic desire for the processed and carb-loaded? Here enters GoNanas, the brainchild of School of Information senior Annie Slabotsky and LSA senior Morgan Lerner. GoNanas produces a variety of banana breads, all gluten-free (many vegan friendly as well) that replace all the negative ingredients associated with baked desserts with the kind of stuff that packs a much more nutritious punch, all detailed by Slabotsky in an interview with The Daily.\nBut GoNanas hasn\u2019t always been supplying places like Fred\u2019s, Replenish and Literati with their delicious breads. Like all small businesses, Slabotsky and Lerner started out as freshman with a simple goal in mind: \u201cWe\u2019re really driven by our mission in this idea that we can bring healthy, accessible food to busy college kids that are on the go and want to have a dessert but don\u2019t want to grab a donut or a refined sugar-filled muffin. So we want to give this treat \u2014 especially to those people who are vegan or gluten-free or nut-free or dairy-free, we are all allergen-free \u2014 and being able to provide this healthy, nutritious dessert is what inspires us,\u201d Slabotsky said.\nWhat is most appealing about GoNanas is not only the nutritional value of their work, but also the variety they bring to an otherwise standard treat, with current flavors including pumpkin and chocolate chip \u2014 and with this variety brings a sustainable edge to their company. GoNanas works with the seasons provide fresh new flavors to their customers while keeping in mind how they can make a positive environmental impact with their food.\nWith an eye on health and sustainability, GoNanas is the perfect one-two punch of a delicious, sustainable snack without all the negative effects of typical, dessert-like foods. Starting with a family recipe, Slabotsky and Lerner are pioneering what it means to satisfy a sweet tooth in a fast-paced, health-conscious society \u2014 especially one in a huge college town. With an eye at expanding their clientele in the future, Slabotsky also reflected on the unique quality of their bread.\nNext time you\u2019re in a mild state of panic reviewing your organic chemistry notes or slamming out a paper on the role of carriages in Jane Austen, think about grabbing a slice of GoNanas bread before running to Walgreens for a candy bar \u2014 your body and mind will definitely thank you for it."}

A two wheeler insurance is not only mandatory under the law, it is the necessity of the hour. So while you enjoy a sweet ride in your new fancy bike with a fancy registration number, ride safe with two wheeler insurance."}
{"text":"Mikesell's are one of the world's oldest Chips companies, so they have understandably had a few branding changes over the years. This latest design features a photographic image of the flavor and contents, which works depending on the flavoring - this is a not-so-good-case because you have photographic imagery mixed with cartoon flames. The latest logo design has an odd stamp type serrated edge. The flavor has a color coded box, but we think they missed a trick here. The creamy colored bottom section of the bag looks innocuous as a background, but the top is a dark blue (for the Groovy range) for all the flavors. This should be flavor color coded.\nThese were not Kettle Cooked Chips so the crunch was not hard, firm and brittle. Instead these were thicker than the average Chip so the crunch was softer and more food like, than Chip like. A crunchy, but somewhat muffled sound.\n'Groovy' relates to the Ridged design of the Chips - geddit. This certainly made them thicker than Mikesell's regular Chips. Also interesting was the liberal seasoning that saw the odd Chip fairly naked while the fully clothed members of the club were coated in a dark and thick orange seasoning powder.\nThe Nose Plunge test revealed a slightly smoky paprika hot sauce aroma. Often, with an interestingly titled flavor, the first question is - What is in it? Here it is more of a case of what is NOT in it! The little Chip geniuses that stir away at hubble pots of fancy ingredients in Chips factories (we imagine they all look like Wizard of Oz munchkins), have certainly a got a combo going here. We obviously went for the darker colored Chips first, and unlike so many spicy, hot sauce Chips, these were actually, shock horror, hot! Best of all, they were not hot, as in - here is a challenge. They were hot and spicy nice."}

Every day a new piece of technology is added to the mix and a business must adapt to it. But when it is a seasoned company, it can be hard to adapt to the newest technology. So how has technology saved other businesses and industries?\nMany years ago, music was only portable with the help of a large boom box with a cassette tape. Boom boxes made it possible to take music on the go but these devices were not lightweight. But as technology evolved, it made it possible for people to carry their favorite music around with them. With the invention of the Walkman, Discman, and MP3 Players, people no longer needed a radio to listen to their favorite tunes. With falling sales and fewer listeners, the radio industry had to learn to adapt to the growing popularity of the portable device market. One way these radio stations adopted was to go portable for their audience with the invention of apps and streaming services like Spotify and Pandora. One of the biggest radio companies, iHeartRadio, upgraded to an app, allowing mobile users to listen to their radio stations anywhere, request songs, and listen to their own music playlist.\nAt the height of its business, Blockbuster was sold to Viacom a whopping $8.4 Billion dollars, much of the company\u2019s value came from its late-fee revenue. In 2000, the company took in a staggering $800 million in late fees and turned down an offer to purchase the anti-late fee competitor Netflix. It turns out this rejection would be the end of Blockbuster. After a failed \u201cNo Late Fee\u201d campaign and a failed match up with Enron Broadband Services for on-demand services, Blockbuster went under. Failing to adapt to the technology era and missed opportunities forced Blockbuster to shut their doors.\nWhile technology is often scary for an older business that is set in its ways, adapting can spare those business owners the heartbreak of shutting the doors for good. Don\u2019t go the way of countless other businesses, adapt and embrace technology."}
{"text":"I\u2019ve left it such a long time to write up our camping holiday to North Devon, that it wouldn\u2019t be realistic now to break it down day by day. Therefore, here\u2019s an overview and some pictures to whet your appetite.\nThis was the poet\u2019s first visit to North Devon, so the first day was spent giving him a bit of a tour. We drove along all of the coast, down as far as Woolacombe. It was very windy. Gales were recorded at over 60mph in our neck of the woods, but they were much, much stronger in the north of England at the same time.\nThe first night was dreadful with those winds. It\u2019s quite ironic that we weren\u2019t able to put the windbreak up and by the time the wind dropped later in the week, the end of the tent that the windbreak usually went around was so damaged, it was held together with guy ropes. So the windbreak stayed in the roofbox on the car.\nWe lost the only pole that goes with our tent. It snapped in a couple of places and had to be repaired with gaffer tape. Fortunately, we had a spare pole back home so we could leave this one in the bin when we left. We also lost at least one guy-tab, so that will need repairing before we take the tent out again.\nWe stopped off at Ilfracombe to get something to eat, a few supplies and to take the first photographs. Back in the day, when I used to go to North Devon with my parent, we\u2019d spend almost every evening in Ilfracombe, where my brother used to fish from the pier.\nThe next photo-stop was Woolacombe, which was where my family pitched their caravan for six years on the trot. We visited Little Roadway Farm, where we used to take the caravan, and we went down to the beach, where it was still incredibly windy.\nWhen we were kids, this beach at Woolacombe was always, always packed. It\u2019s a massive stretch of sand that goes a very long way out to the sea when the tide is out. There were several Land Rovers that patrolled the beach throughout the day collecting lost children. Lost children used to gravitate towards my dad too, for some reason. If it were today, he\u2019d probably be arrested!\nFrom the beach at Woolacombe you can see Lundy Island \u2013 sometimes. Rain used to follow my dad everywhere he went. It still does. And when we were in North Devon we had a saying: if you could see Lundy, it was going to rain; if you couldn\u2019t see Lundy, it already was raining. It was no different on our visit this time. But we could see Lundy on the two days we were in the right place. Our problem wasn\u2019t the rain, though. It was the wind.\nThe next day I took the poet to Watersmeet. This is where the West and East Lyn rivers meet, and I knew he would love the picturesque beauty spot where salmon and dippers can be seen on the babbling waters. It did rain today and there was such a massive queue to get into the tea rooms there that we abandoned the idea and carried on with our journey.\nOne of my most favourite places on Earth is Exmoor. I love the wild-ness of it. I love the heather in the summer. I love to be able to see the sea one way and miles and miles of moorland the other way. Even when it\u2019s foggy or raining I\u2019m happy to park up on Exmoor and just gaze. Naturally this meant a drive around Exmoor, and I hope the two pictures I\u2019ve shared demonstrate at least two of the aspects I love about the place.\nAfter Exmoor, we dropped down into Putsborough late one day. Because the beach at Woolacombe used to get so busy, Putsborough was where we headed as a family \u201cin the old days\u201d. There are rocks there, and lots of places that can act as markers for children finding their way back to their families from the sea.\nYup, you guessed it, we were on the dog-free beach. Oops. Ah well, at least he had a good time, and he behaved himself very, very well.\nBack up on Exmoor, we had to pay a visit to Lorna Doone country in the Doone Valley. Lorna Doone was, of course, a figment of RD Blackmore\u2019s imagination. This doesn\u2019t stop a small church in the middle of the moors claiming to be the one where \u201cthe shooting\u201d took place. When we were little, there was a patch of \u201cblood\u201d on the floor of the church where the victim was alleged to have bled out. By the time I took the poet, this little stain was actually rust from a leaky radiator!\nWe camped at the Camping and Caravan Club camp site above Lynton & Lynmouth, a small town right next to the Valley of the Rocks. Here there were such spectacular sunsets that we had to have a few goes at photographing this beautiful place. So after tea at least twice we went down there to take the pictures.\nPossibly one of the most southern places on this north coast of Devon is the small fishing village of Clovelly. Here a cobbled road takes the pedestrian (vehicles aren\u2019t allowed) down a steep and winding hill to the harbour. There\u2019s a car park at the top of the hill and an extensive visitor centre through which an admission fee is paid. There\u2019s also a Land Rover that takes those visitors that need or want a lift down the back way to the harbour.\nWe walked down into the village, but we jumped on the Land Rover to come back. And as we were in that part of the country, when we got back to the car we continued to drive to Hartland Point where there\u2019s a lighthouse. Unfortunately, public access to the lighthouse was closed while we were there due to them doing some land-moving work. We did, however, get a cracking view of Lundy Island.\nOn our last day, we headed back to Ilfracombe for a wander around the town and harbour. I was most disappointed to see that the pier there is much smaller than I remember when my brother fished from it. I\u2019m not sure if it was made bigger in my memory or if they\u2019ve shortened it. It\u2019s still, however, a very lovely place.\nBack in Lynton & Lynmouth, we had a final wander round and a trip down the Lynton & Lynton Cliff Railway and back, and we had fish and chips for tea.\nI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this sneak preview into a part of the country that I love very much. And now the poet loves it too. I also hope the selection of pictures I\u2019ve made does it justice. He took several hundred! So I was unable to share them all. However, you can see more on his Instagram or on his website."}

{"text":"The purpose of the volunteer program at Welland is to both increase food access by maintaining a productive Orchard using organic, holistic orcharding practices, and increase food literacy by educating volunteers on fruit tree care, harvest and use. We hope to make this process fun and engaging, and to this end have a few ways that volunteers can get involved in depending on what they\u2019re looking for and what their time commitment is.\nThis program is for folks who really want to zero in on learning about specific aspects of fruit tree care, such as nutrition, pest & disease management and pruning. These volunteers will be mixing and applying holistic sprays, pruning trees and monitoring diseases & pests according to the season. They will be working closely with the Coordinator to implement the holistic tree care plan for the Orchard, which is based on the book The Holistic Orchard: Tree Fruits & Berries the Biological Way by Michael Phillips (book not provided).\nVolunteers meet once monthly for a full day of orchard care where we will focus on tasks that are particular to each time of the year. Some of the topics we will cover include: pruning, grafting, nursery management, integrated pest management, fruit quality, and harvest.\nEach session will run from 10 am to 4 pm on either Mondays or Tuesdays (to be determined) and will typically include one hour of teaching & observation at the orchard, followed by 4 hours of hands-on practice in managing a community orchard. At lunch break, which can be had picnic style in the park, participants will have the opportunity get to know each other and share their interest and expertise.\nTo apply, download and fill out the application form here and send it to Julia at welland@lifecyclesproject.ca by Monday January 28th at noon. Please feel free to get in touch with any questions!\nWork Bees are regular volunteer days when anyone who is wiling is welcome to come by and lend a hand with maintaining the orchard. These days are a great opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Orchard, meet new people, and learn a bit about fruit trees, pollinators or soil building. There\u2019s a low commitment level, you can just come when you have a free Sunday. Tasks vary with the season, but generally work bees are family friendly times to come and pitch in on things like mulching, weeding, fruit thinning, or harvest; each time is a little bit different.\nWork Bees are every 1st and 3rd Sunday of the month from March to October (except holiday weekends). In the spring & fall we meet in the afternoon to take advantage of warmer afternoons, and in the summer we meet in the morning before it gets too hot to work!\nDates for 2019 will be announced soon!\nIf you are interested in helping with pruning in February, please email the Coordinator at welland@lifecyclesproject.ca with your availability (weekdays or weekends) and level of pruning experience (beginners welcome! We just also need enough experienced folks to help out too). Pruning dates will be scheduled based on volunteer availability.\nTo stay up-to-date with times & activities for the drop-in work parties, sign up for our email list by sending a message to our Coordinator (see above email) and\/or \u2018like\u2019 our Facebook page and keep an eye out for upcoming events.\nIs your school or workplace looking for an opportunity to get their hands dirty, spend the day outside working together & contribute to an amazing community project?

{"text":"This incredible period of history lasted over 1,000,000 years. Dramatic changes in climate shaped the landscape we see today. The oldest period is known as the Stone Age because of the main material people used to make tools with at the time. Remains of these tools, and the animals that were hunted with them can still be found around this area and many of them are on display in Lowewood Museum.\nThere are three periods within the Stone Age, which mark changes in the stone tools that were made. During the Palaeolithic, or Old Stone Age, the main tool was the handaxe. This was a large piece of flint with one rounded edge that fitted comfortably in the hand. There was also a sharp edge that could be used for a range of different jobs such as cutting meat and wood, scraping animal hides or making other tools. In the Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age, stone tools got smaller and a range of different tools were made to suit different jobs. In the Neolithic, or New Stone Age, stone tools were polished which made them much stronger.\nDuring the Palaeolithic period there were great changes in the climate between cold and warm periods. During cold periods the landscape round here was covered by wide open grasslands where woolly mammoth, woolly rhino and bison thrived. In warmer periods grasslands were replaced by forests which suited different animals, such as straight tusked elephants and aurochs, an ancient type of wild cattle.\nMolar tooth of a woolly mammoth.\nBone of a straight tusked elephant, flint axes and hammer stone.\nDuring the Mesolithic period which started about 8,800 BC, the climate warmed again. Forests grew and different animals such as wild boar, deer, foxes and badgers moved here across the land bridge with Europe. Mammoth and other animals that preferred cold conditions moved further north and across to what we now know as Siberia. The land bridge was finally cut off about 6,500BC when sea levels rose. People had to adapt their tools to suit hunting different animals in a different landscape. They made small arrowheads for hunting deer in forests and smaller scrapers for cutting and cleaning meat and skins.\nIn the Neolithic period, people used stronger polished stone tools to cut down trees and plough land so they could grow food by farming as well as hunting.\nThe Bronze Age began around 2,600BC when people worked out how to extract metal ore from rock. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, could be heated until it turned into liquid, and then poured into clay moulds to make axe heads useful for clearing even more land for farming. The majority of Bronze Age objects in the Museum\u2019s collection were found in Half Hide Lane, Cheshunt during an archaeological dig in 1983.\nAround 800 BC, the Iron Age began when people worked out how to create the high temperatures needed to heat iron and hammer it in to shape. Iron was even stronger than bronze, allowing for more tools and equipment to be made. Wooden fragments on display in Lowewood Museum are evidence of a possible Iron Age Lake Village was found at Fishers Green.\nFind out more about the prehistoric people, animals and places of Broxbourne within Lowewood Museum\u2019s Braham Gallery.\nA museum\u2019s mission is to be at the heart of the local community. Lowewood Museum\u2019s Development Officer, Carly Hearn, gives an insight into the creation of memory boxes \u2013 which when used as part of reminiscence therapy can help reconnect a person with their identity. The project was supported through funding by Broxbourne Borough Council, Epping Forest District Council and Hertfordshire Association of Museums.\nHave you ever visited your local museum? Do you know what services they provide for older people? Lowewood Museum in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, is one of many museums playing a supportive role to residential and nursing homes providing outreach work which uses their collection in productive and meaningful ways. In 2015, the Lowewood Museum launched a set of memory boxes containing nostalgic objects for local care homes and community organisations.\nMemory boxes are often used for reminiscence therapy, helping to reconnect a person with their identity and to improve communication, mood and overall wellbeing. Reminiscence therapy encourages social interaction by giving people the opportunity to share stories and experiences through a fun and stimulating activity. It also helps to bring together people of different backgrounds and generations, often helping to improve relationships between carers and the older person. The Cochrane Collaboration Review on reminiscence therapy for dementia showed that for 144 of the participants studied, there was evidence to show that reminiscence therapy improved cognition, mood and general behavioural function.\nLowewood Museum is not alone with this as many museums across the country offer memory boxes which are often free to hire. These easy to use low-cost boxes, filled with memory-jogging objects, can have a significant impact on someone\u2019s wellbeing and evidence has also shown that reminiscence therapy can also significantly reduce care-giver strain when family carers are also involved (Thorgrimsen, 2002).\nJoint reminiscence work involving people with dementia and their family care givers is a good example of relationship-centred care (Wood B, Spector AE, Jones CA, Orrell M, Davies SP, 2005) and evidence has shown that reminiscence therapy can assist in the reduction of depression in older people without dementia. (Bohlmeijer, 2003). Involving carers and older people without dementia in both the development and delivery of the boxes was vital for Lowewood\u2019s project, as from the outset it was essential to recognise the central role played by volunteers and carers in nursing and residential care. With the ever increasing demand on care home staff, the Museum offered a base for community groups to work together producing a set of memory boxes which they could take ownership of, helping to promote to more individuals.\nFor Lowewood\u2019s project, volunteers from the Lea Valley University of the Third Age (U3A) were recruited to help develop the boxes, working alongside staff from local nursing home, Quantum Care\u2019s Belmont View, flexi care and independent living provider, B3Living, visual impaired organisation, Vision4Growth and speech and language therapy group, Cheshunt Aphasia, helping to ensure the boxes met the needs of their residents and group members. By working with Visual Impaired Organisation, Vision4Growth and speech and language support group, Cheshunt Aphasia, the Museum ensured expert advice was sought for residents in care who had suffered strokes, or other causes of speech and sight impairment. All those involved received training from a reminiscence specialist on how to use reminiscence therapy in person-centred care.\nThe final result produced four boxes which incorporated objects from the 1930s onwards appealing to both men and women, arranged in themes including Home Sweet Home, Out on the Town, When We Were Young, and Happy Days. Each box also comprised a support pack for care staff, which includes cue cards for discussion prompts and feedback sheets for sharing reminiscence session ideas between care homes. Popular items within the boxes that have helped to un-lock memories and stimulate discussions include cat\u2019s cradle, Dinky Toys, a school milk bottle, Punch and Judy puppets, seaside postcards, dress and knitting patterns, sunlight soap, men\u2019s razors and ladies hair curlers. We were also careful to include more recent items from the 1970s and 1980s for use with younger residents and people living with early onset dementia. All items were relatively inexpensive, sourced online or through car boot sales and local donations. Within three months of their launch the boxes were fully booked by local care homes and community groups, used in reminiscence sessions by over 300 people. Lowewood Museum has built on this initial success to develop new reminiscence based resources and support for care homes, including reminiscence sessions and tea and chat sessions at the Museum.\nSt Catherine\u2019s Care Home, Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. Lowewood Museum\u2019s Home Sweet Home Memory Box.\nOne of the care homes making use of the boxes is St Catherine\u2019s in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. Activity and Lifestyle Facilitator, Carol Kerr, first used the boxes in a group setting, sitting with residents and selecting objects one at a time. Carol spoke of how the objects prompted many memories with the residents, with many stating, \u201cI had one of those\u201d and \u201c\u2018I haven\u2019t seen one of those for years\u201d. Carol also said that \u2018some of our younger member of staff had never seen some of the items before and so it empowered our residents, to be able to explain to them what their uses were\u2019. Carol went on to explain how the room was filled with laughter and how a lovely afternoon was spent reminiscing and sharing stories.\nCarol also used the memory boxes with individuals in a quieter setting. Ellie who is 87 prefers to sit in a quiet lounge and carers often find it hard to interest and engage her in any activity. However, when a member of staff walked into the lounge wearing the old fashioned apron, (or pinny as they called it!), Ellie threw her head back and laughed. \u201cI used to wear one of those\u201d she said, and remained cheerful and was happy to look through the box. The staff found this very rewarding.\nLowewood Museum\u2019s memory boxes are available to hire for groups. They can be borrowed free of charge \u2013 for more information contact us on museum.leisure@broxbourne.gov.uk or 01992 445596.\nUsing memory boxes in person-centred care is an inexpensive resource offering meaningful results. With the ever-increasing pressure on care home staff to fulfil their daily tasks, it is perhaps their local museum who can offer the support in the development of reminiscence resources. If you haven\u2019t visited your local museum, why not find out where it is and see what they have to offer in terms of resources and support for your care home? A museum\u2019s mission is to be at the heart of its local community, as a main hub helping to bring together local communities, groups and individuals of all ages, backgrounds and abilities. Museums should exist as a place to offer all individuals the opportunity to explore and re-connect with the past and thus can play a crucial role in supporting nursing and residential care homes with the objects they collect and the vibrant outreach work they offer.\nWood B, Spector AE, Jones CA, Orrell M, Davies SP (2005) Reminscence Therapy for Demntia.

{"text":"On May 11, 2017, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Canadian physiotherapy regulators that proposes a new registration category to help improve access to care within Canada.\nThe purpose is to support access to beneficial physiotherapy treatment where there may be physical barriers to care or a scarcity of qualified physiotherapists. This will allow physiotherapists who practise in one province, but wish to provide care to patients in another, to do so through tele-rehabilitation or in person for the purposes of continuing care or accessing physiotherapy services that are not otherwise available.\nNinety-five percent of the Canadian landmass is serviced by only 8% of registered physiotherapists. This creates vast areas where patients have difficulty accessing care due to distance, bad weather or the absence of physiotherapy services.\nThis new type of extended access licence (the name of the registration category may vary from province to province) is designed to allow physiotherapists to continue care initiated in the physiotherapist\u2019s primary jurisdiction, where the patient would benefit from continued service in a second jurisdiction; or the provision of physiotherapy where services are not available in a second jurisdiction but would benefit the patient.\nFor more information, watch this CAPR webpage for future updates, or contact the registration manager at the College governing the jurisdiction within which you are interested in practising."}

{"text":"Dog bites are a serious matter, yet many dog bite incidents go unreported. Our Waterbury personal injury attorneys have seen numerous potential cases go unfiled, simply because people make excuses for the incident taking place. If a dog has bitten you, understand that reporting the incident is important.\nYes, this may be true. \u201cPerson Bit by Dog\u201d is hardly a headline that will sell papers. However, this shouldn\u2019t stop you from reporting an incident. Car accidents are also a common occurrence, but injuries sustained from a dog bite can be just as severe as an auto collision. The problem with not reporting a dog bite is that you might not be the only person to have been attacked by that dog. If no one reports dog attacks, then that dog will continue to injure others with no repercussions.\nTrue, but by reporting the incident you would not be holding the dog liable\u2014you would be holding the owner liable. A dog owner is responsible for monitoring their pets and taking proper precautions necessary to ensure the safety of people around them. If an owner is aware that their dog has aggressive tendencies, they must post warning signs on their property and appropriately muzzle or restrain their dog. A dog might not know better, but his or her owner should.\nSure, you may not want to report a little nip, but most dog bites that cause injury are not just a peck. A dog bite or dog attack can cause serious injury. Also, in most dog bite cases, the victim is a child. A dog bite to a small child can cause years of physical and psychological damages.\nIf a dog has attacked you or someone you love, do what you can and report the incident. Our Waterbury dog bite lawyers have extensive experience representing victims of dog bites and animal attacks."}
{"text":"Buying used cars offers big savings to the consumer. Plus, there are more options to choose from. But, which cars are the best to buy used? This answer may vary based on your specific needs. Maybe you are buying a car for a first-time driver, or maybe you need to buy a durable work truck. You need to assess your personal needs before buying a used car, but let\u2019s explore some of the best-used cars consumers can buy. When we talk about which vehicles are the best we are talking about a used car\u2019s overall value, reliability, efficiency, and cost.\nThe Camry\u2019s high gas efficiency, durability, and reliability make it a great used car option. These facets of the Toyota Camry also help it retain its value over time better than most other cars. So if you choose to buy a used Toyota Camry, you\u2019re getting a vehicle that not only performs well and can take a ton of mileage, but you\u2019re also getting a used car that retains its value over time. This makes the Camry one of the best-used car options on the market.\nWhat makes the Outback such an awesome used car? The Outback has standard all-wheel drive. It is packed with Subaru\u2019s suite of safety features, and it has a ton of versatile storage space for whatever life throws at you. These used cars are popular options for parents buying their kids their first car. This is because of the Outback\u2019s high safety rating and great value. The Outback is tough, reliable, safe, and efficient. If you\u2019re looking for the best-used car to buy, the Subaru Outback makes a strong case.\nAre you looking for a durable, full-sized truck? The Honda Ridgeline may be the best full-sized used car to buy. The Ridgeline boasts a powerful V6 engine, a huge cargo bed, and best of all it offers a smooth, comfortable ride that most other trucks cannot match. The Honda Ridgeline is one of the best-used cars to buy because of its value, power, and efficiency. If you need a truck for hauling site equipment or moving materials, the Honda Ridgeline is a great used car option.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a smaller, manual transmission used car, the Mini Cooper is one of the best available. These cars are stylish, small, get great gas mileage, and come with manual transmission for the serious drivers. This is a great used car option for people who love driving stick, and people who live in cities and need to park their car in tight spaces. The Mini Cooper comes at a great price too so when you\u2019re shopping for your next used car check one out!\nIf the used car you are looking for is a full-size sedan, the Chevrolet Impala is a smart choice. This is a front-wheel drive vehicle, and over the years has consistently been packed full of awesome tech features. This is one of the best used cars available for consumers looking for a four-door sedan that has great technology features.\nThese are just a few of the best-used cars you can buy. Depending on your needs there may be a better model out there for you. Come and visit our team at First Class Auto Land in Philadelphia and browse our extensive selection of used cars. Our friendly sales staff will help you find the perfect car for your current needs at a great price!\nBefore you call a dealership with an inquiry or even pay them a visit, it is wise to first figure out what kind of vehicle you want and what features are important to you. Then do some research on finding a vehicle that matches and is manageable financially.\nFigure out which vehicle best fits your needs, lifestyle, preferences, and budget. For example, if you are single, you may opt for a small sedan or coupe, however, if you have a large family you might need a minivan or an SUV with third-row seating. If you can, avoid just looking for the cheapest vehicle in your category. You may save money on the purchase price, but keep in mind there\u2019s a reason why the car is priced so low. It may be because of age, high mileage, general condition, or it could be in need of repairs, all of which are likely to cost you more money in the not too distant future.\nOnce you figure out what type of vehicle fits your needs and preferences, and how much of a down payment and monthly payments you can comfortably afford, you can start searching online for the best match. If you have purchased a car previously and were happy with the dealership, you may want to stick with that dealer. If not, start with two or three dealers and compare the make, model, features and price with your ideal vehicle.\nMost people will need financing when buying a car. There are some who do buy their cars with cash but that\u2019s primarily wealthy buyers, or those who are buying very inexpensive vehicles. If you have a high credit score you can probably get pre-approved with a fairly low interest rate from your bank or credit union. For those with an average or lower credit score, just about all new and used car dealerships have a variety of financing options available, depending on the customers\u2019 credit score and history. And even if your score is only fair, there may be some ability to negotiate the rate with the dealership, especially if you can make a down payment; the more you can put down the better your chances for a lower rate. If you don\u2019t know your credit score, there are a number of online sites that you can get it from for free, and everyone is entitled to a free credit report annually from each of the three credit reporting agencies \u2013 Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.\nAfter you get a price from the car salesman, don\u2019t forget to factor in all the additional costs, such as sales tax, title registration, notary fees, and possible options like an extended warranty. One of the most important costs to be considered, of course, is the monthly payment amount, which is determined by the interest rate, the down payment, and the number of months of the loan. Keeping the term as short as you can comfortably afford can save you money in the long run by reducing the overall interest you will pay. The key word here is comfortable; you don\u2019t want all of your combined monthly payments to be so tight that an unexpected expense causes you to miss some payments. And don\u2019t forget to estimate the cost of insurance and operating expenses when you calculate how much you can afford monthly.\nIt\u2019s certainly quite common for most of us to get pretty excited when we get a new car, but you don\u2019t want that excitement to work against you when you\u2019re still working out the details. While some salesmen may try to take advantage of your excitement by talking you into a car that\u2019s really too expensive for you, most dealerships are very honorable and actually do what they can to make sure you buy a vehicle you can afford. After all, they want you to be a future repeat customer, which won\u2019t happen if your car gets repossessed. Be sure you ask questions about all the charges and payments and be confident you have a complete understanding of all the financial details. Take your time and get all the information necessary to make the best decision.\nCertainly, you want to get the best financial deal possible, and you may be able to negotiate a lower purchase price and possibly even some of the fees and options. However, some fees are definitely not, negotiable, such as registration fees and taxes. Car dealerships doe not have any control over those charges and the money goes straight to the various government agencies.\nAfter you have negotiated a deal with the salesman, he may talk to you about different add-ons that are available. You may have been at the dealership for hours and want to finish the paperwork quickly, get in your new car, and finally get out of there. Don\u2019t automatically say yes to anything just to speed up the process. This can cause you to pay more than you need or want to spend. Remember the last line of one of the previous paragraphs, it can save you money: Take your time and get all the information necessary to make the best decision.\nFirst Class Auto Land is a third generation, family owned and operated used car dealership that has been providing customers with the most trusted, straight-forward car buying experience in the Tri-State area.

Buying a used car can be a smart financial move for many drivers. In addition to avoiding the depreciation a new car experiences, you\u2019ll pay significantly less for the vehicle, save money on taxes, and probably even pay less for insurance.\nHowever, the process of buying a used car can be daunting. How do you know if you\u2019re getting a good deal? How can you be sure that you\u2019re not buying a lemon? Arming yourself with some basic knowledge before you start the process can help it all be a lot less intimidating. Here are 10 tips to keep in mind while you\u2019re shopping for your next used car.\nThanks to the internet, it\u2019s easier than ever to go to a dealership armed with knowledge. Take the time to browse the selections of your local used car dealerships to get an idea of what you can expect to spend for the vehicle you want. Being informed from the beginning will help you feel confident that you\u2019re getting a great deal.\nFigure out the maximum amount you can afford to spend over the lifetime of your car payments and be sure to stay well inside that amount. If you\u2019re planning on using financing, research your options and get pre-approved for a car loan if possible. This will augment your buying power when you start the actual process of purchasing a vehicle.\nWhen budgeting for your used car, remember that maintenance issues may come up sooner than if you were buying a new car. Since there will already be some mileage on your vehicle, routine maintenance costs may pop up sooner than if you were buying a brand-new one. Research the exact make and model you\u2019re interested in purchasing to learn what the average ownership costs and reliability ratings are for that vehicle.\nin terms of features, figure out in advance which are most important to you, and use this wish list to narrow down your options. Many used car buyers want to know what the best car is to buy used, and the answer is: it depends! Will you be commuting long distances? Maybe efficient gas mileage is most important to you. Do you go on long road trips with your family? A roomy interior with plenty of storage space and upgraded entertainment features might be ideal. Don\u2019t worry too much about finding the best options at the cheapest price, focus instead on the right fit for your needs and lifestyle.\nThere are some rules to buying a used car that can be safely broken and doing so might lead you to find a diamond in the rough. For example, many people won\u2019t consider a used car over 100,000 miles, but a well-maintained car with heavy mileage likely still has many thousands of miles of life left in it. Many used car buyers assume that luxury car models will provide the best value, but don\u2019t overlook baseline models with upgrades. Do your research and break the rules to find great deals other buyers might overlook.\nPrivate sellers can be a gamble. You could either be getting a great deal, or you could walk away with a lemon. A used car dealership has its reputation to uphold, a larger selection of cars, can provide the car\u2019s history and assistance securing financing, and usually can offer various extended warranty options. A private seller is rarely able to provide even one of these things to you.\nSince inventory can change quickly at used car dealerships, and prices can also fluctuate, save screenshots of any vehicle listings that catch your eye for future reference. You might want to start a spreadsheet for comparing prices and calculating potential expenses.\nThe Out-The-Door Price Is what you\u2019ll be paying in total, including taxes and fees. Common fees include documentation fees and registration fees. While these vary from dealership to dealership, having these additional costs added to the total price of your vehicle is normal and to be expected. That said, talk to your salesperson about any fees being added on to the out-the-door total, and make sure you understand exactly what you\u2019re paying.\nSince every used car Is unique, make sure that you have the chance to try out the actual car you\u2019re thinking about taking home. Even if you\u2019ve seen and driven the same model vehicle elsewhere, you need to be sure you test drive the exact car you plan to buy. Be certain all the features are operational, and that it handles and drives to your complete satisfaction.\nKnowledge is power! Make sure you know as much as possible about the history of the car you are considering. Most used car dealerships will include a car history report, like CarFax, as a matter of course. These reports will let you know important events in your car\u2019s history, such as mileage accuracy, accidents, number of owners, and service records.\nWith these ten tips in mind, you should be able to buy your next used car like a pro. At First Class Auto Land, our friendly team has years of experience helping people just like you find your ideal pre-owned vehicle at an affordable price. Take a look at our online inventory; every vehicle we sell has undergone a complete inspection and comes with a free warranty and Carfax Report. Want to learn more about our financing options: call to set up an appointment, or simply stop by and talk to one of our professional team members.\nTime to replace your car? Like millions of other Americans, you might be interested in purchasing a used vehicle instead of a brand new one. This is a simple way to save money and avoid potential issues associated with brand new models, such as undiscovered faults and recalls.\nThe latest cars from leading manufacturers may be advertised as must-have models packed with trendy features, but their hefty price tags are more than most of us can afford: research shows the average cost of a new car has now exceeded $31,000.\nWhen you settle on buying a pre-owned vehicle, though, another choice remains: should you buy from a professional dealer or a private seller? Does it make much of a difference which you go for? It does, for there are numerous advantages to purchasing from a dealer. So, let\u2019s take a look at the most important ones.\nDoes this car meet all of my needs?\nCan I get to work and back, pick the kids up and carry groceries safely in it?\nWill its fuel consumption be cost-effective for my budget?\nHowever, another vital aspect to consider is its history. While a new car comes fresh from a manufacturer, pre-owned vehicles have been driven by one or more previous buyers or leasers for a number of years. If the car has been involved in accidents or undergone multiple repairs, you need to know about that.\nWhile many private auto sellers are upfront with their vehicle\u2019s history, unfortunately, not all are as honest as they should be. Some private sellers may only care about unloading their car and getting your money. They\u2019re not regulated or subject to legal obligations like a professional dealer is and can simply gloss over the car\u2019s past if they don\u2019t want to disclose any important details. If you\u2019re not careful, you could buy a used car that has experienced serious mechanical problems or even been written off as totaled by an insurance company. If you find out after the sale and try tracking the seller down for a refund, you may find they are untraceable.\nWith a registered professional used car dealership, you avoid all of this. They have an obligation to inform you of relevant details of a vehicle\u2019s past, through a CarFax report or a similar service.\nWhile a private seller may seem to be happy to provide an honest breakdown of the car\u2019s history, you have no reason to believe they\u2019re telling the truth. Dealers, on the other hand, have regulations to follow and their reputations to consider: one poor customer experience can have a significant negative impact on them. This is especially true today when dissatisfied buyers have review sites and social media through which to share their stories. The best dealerships will give you all the vehicle history information you request and ensure any accidents or repairs are fully disclosed.\nFinancing a used car can be a challenge, especially when buying from a private seller. Why? Because the vehicle\u2019s owner will expect all of the money in a single payment. This can take months upon months of saving up, which is often no easy feat with bills, mortgage or rent payments, children, pets and more devouring your hard-earned cash. Waiting so long may not be an option if you have an immediate need for a dependable vehicle for work or lifestyle commitments.\nWhen you visit a trustworthy used car dealership, though, you will probably be offered in-house financing assistance with a fast approval. This is ideal if you have a low credit rating and need to secure an auto loan to fund your purchase, as banks are typically reluctant to lend to anyone with poor credit. In-house financing means your dealer will assess your situation, discuss your options and help you get a loan that works for your budget. This eliminates the stress of trying to scrape the money together for a car advertised by a private seller. It makes finding the right car at the right price much easier and offers the freedom to pay in installments. As a result, your entire purchase process will be far more pleasant. Ethical dealers tend to offer reasonable down payments too, making their services even more accessible to buyers on tight budgets.\nWill Your Used Car Be Under A Warranty?\nWhen you buy a used car from a private seller, you normally have no warranty. And no recourse if there turns out to be a problem with the car. This can be a problem because cars sold by private sellers are usually sold As-Is, and once you drive away, you\u2019ll be on your own if anything goes wrong. Unscrupulous sellers may not even provide you with correct contact information, rendering them unreachable in the future. In either case, you would be looking at extra costs for any repairs or replacements on top of the purchase price.\nReputable used car dealers, on the other hand, normally include some type of warranty on their vehicles, giving you an extra level of protection and added peace of mind when you drive your vehicle away from the dealership. Providing their customers with warranties only helps to strengthen a dealer\u2019s customer service and reputation. Post-purchase care means a lot to them but may mean nothing to private sellers.\nThe best-used car dealerships will have their vehicles inspected before putting them on sale. This is vital to identify any potential issues that must be addressed and to provide customers with all the essential details on their purchase. Any repairs or replacements necessary will be taken care of, essentially making aspects of the car as good as new in some cases. As a result, you can rest assured that you\u2019re investing in a stable car that functions as it should.\nPrivate sellers may conduct inspections and offer paperwork to prove it, but again, they\u2019re under no obligation to do so. Even if a seller is not honest with you, it is usually very difficult to prove. Are you willing to take a chance and risk all that money? Certain private sellers might be unwilling to agree to have the vehicle inspected before you hand over your cash. They may even take offense and assume you\u2019re questioning their integrity. And if you take the car for an inspection after the purchase has been completed, you could find it\u2019s not actually fit for the road in its current condition, leaving you with a potentially unsafe vehicle that\u2019s only going to cost you more money to repair.\nTrying to find the right car for you can take weeks or months when browsing the private market. After all, the majority of private sellers are only selling one vehicle, not a whole selection to choose from. Visiting a used car dealership gives you access to far more choices, ranging from cars and trucks to SUVs and minivans.\nIf you have a fairly flexible budget and no clear idea of exactly what you\u2019re looking for, exploring the variety of vehicles at your local dealership can be very helpful and certainly a big time-saver. You can scan through their online inventories or wander their lots and check out dozens of different options that will appeal to diverse tastes and demands.\nYou can spend hours weighing your choices and considering all the possibilities. Professional dealers will have more patience and training than private sellers too. They won\u2019t rush you into deciding or handing over the cash; they\u2019ll respect your right to take your time over such an important purchase.\nThe Buyers Guide has to be placed in clear sight on a car available for sale, such as under the windshield wiper or taped to one of the windows. The Buyers Guide can be a major aid when purchasing a used car and is obviously unavailable from private sellers. If you have little knowledge or experience of buying vehicles, you could be unsure what questions to ask or what to look out for. A private seller solely interested in making easy money may choose to take advantage of this.\nWhen preparing to buy a used car from a private seller, you usually have to do your own research. After all, you\u2019ll want to learn more about the model\u2019s performance, features, potential flaws and more, gleaning information from other drivers\u2019 reviews or manufacturer websites. As you might expect, this can eat up a lot of your free time \u2014 and if you don\u2019t end up buying the car, you could consider this time wasted.\nProfessional dealers, on the other hand, have all the details ready for you. You can learn how suitable the car is, how it handles, what features it offers and other key factors within a few minutes of conversation. As a result, actually finding the ideal vehicle is far less time-consuming.\nYou have to handle the paperwork when buying a used car from a private seller. Not only can this be confusing, especially if you\u2019ve never had to do this before, but it takes time too. If you make a mistake or fail to file the proper documents, you could encounter issues down the road. Reputable dealerships will complete all or most of the paperwork for you during the transaction. They have experience filling the necessary forms in and getting you to sign on the right dotted lines. Your dealer will be happy to talk you through the paperwork and make sure you understand it all. Private sellers may not be so considerate.\nUsed car dealerships will have an online presence, which can take various forms. It may be a selection of testimonials from satisfied customers on their website, offering you an insight into how the dealership helped them get the right vehicle for their needs. It may be impartial and honest feedback on a review site, covering people\u2019s own buying experiences with the business. Checking a dealership\u2019s reputation is a terrific way to decide whether this team will be the right choice for you. Other people\u2019s views can be a valuable resource and are well worth looking into before you visit.\nPrivate sellers are extremely unlikely to have their own website or dedicated social media page. Tracing their history of vehicle sales and activities is much harder, and you have no real way to know how trustworthy they are. In most cases, you\u2019ll be able to contact a used car dealer to discuss their selection of vehicles, financing, warranties and more by live chat, email or phone. The best dealerships invest in quality websites with a catalog of cars to peruse, letting you see what they have in the comfort of your own home.\nAs you can see, there are some undeniable advantages to buying your used car from a reputable professional dealership instead of a private seller. However, the decision is ultimately down to you, so take the time to think it through carefully.\nAt First Class Auto Land, our friendly team has years of experience helping people just like you find your ideal pre-owned vehicle at an affordable price. Take a look at our online inventory; every vehicle we sell has undergone a complete inspection and comes with a free warranty and Carfax Report.

{"text":"Athanasius introduces his material in De Synodis 22, where he consistently refers to the parties gathered as those who wised to receive Arius and \u2018those with him\u2019 back into communion. In this passage Athanasius refrains from calling those gathered \u2018Arians\u2019, but maintains some distinction between them, even though he identifies them as \u2018contriving to receive\u2026the heresy into the Church\u2019. Athasius then moves on in 23 to introduce the first of various letters.\nThe letteer Athanasius provides begins with a denial that the bishops are followers of Arius, since they are bishops and he a presbyter, and a claim to only hold the faith that has been passed from from the beginning. They then declare that having examined Arius\u2019 teaching (his \u2018faith), they have \u201cadmitted him rather than followed him\u201d, clearly marking their superiority to Arius in terms of hierarchy. Then follows the first Antioch creed, presented as a statement of what they have learn \u2018from the first\u2019.\nand remains king and God forever.\nwe believe also concerning the resurrection of flesh and life eternal.\nIt is instructive to compare a few key portions to the Creed of Nicaea 325. In place of Nicaea\u2019s X from X descriptions of the Son, we have only \u201cexisting before all ages, and being with the Father that had begotten him\u201d. \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 (aorist) has shifted to \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 (perfect). There is no explicit disavowal of the Son being created, and the combination of \u2018existed before all ages\u2019 with \u2018had begotten\u2019 creates interpretive \u2018space\u2019 for a pre-creation \u2018gap\u2019 between the Son\u2019s begetting and the Creation\u2019s initio.\nThe soteriological purpose of the economy is severely curtailed to a statement about fulfilling the Father\u2019s will, and an anti-Marcellan clause is added concerning the Son\u2019s eternal kingship and deity. The final rider after \u201cif it be necessary\u201d indicates some need to clarify these two issues, but that they have not yet risen to a level of contention that requires either clear creedal incorporation or the attachment of anathemas.\nThe second creed of Antioch is more famous than the first, because it is put to greater use later on.\njust as our Lord Jesus Christ enjoined the disciples saying, \u201cGo and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\u201d, namely of the Father, being truly Father, of the Son, being truly Son, of the Holy Spirit being truly Holy Spirit, the names not lightly nor idly occurring, but signifying exactly the proprietary hypostasis of each name and rank and glory; as they are three in hypostasis, they are one in concordance.\nHolding then this faith, and holding it before God and Christ from the beginning until the end, we anathematise every heretical heterodoxy. And if anyone teaches besides the sound, right faith of the Scriptures, saying that time, or season, or age either is or occurred before the generation of the Son, let him be anathema. And if anyone says the Son is a creature, as one of the creatures, or an offspring, as one of the offspring, or a product, as one of the produces, and not \u2013 as the Sacred Scriptures have passed down \u2013 the abovementioned things one after another; or if he teaches anything else, or preaches, besides what we received, let him be anathema. For all that has been passed down out of the Sacred Scriptures by the prophets and apostles we truly and reverentially believe and follow.\nThe second creed is much more expansive than the first creed, and as Athanasius says deals with the fact that the first is deficient, by supplementation and expansion.\nFirstly we note the insertion before the main creedal content of \u2018according to the evangelical and apostolic traditon\u2019. There is a definite note here of the importance of non-innovation, to present the creed as simply a statement of what has always been taught, even if not taught in these words and phrases.\n\u2018Father almighty\u2019 reappears from the Nicene, while \u2018Framer and Preserver\u2019 from the first creed is expanded to \u2018Framer, Maker and Preserver\u2019, possibly from a desire to emphasise the Father\u2019s role as not merely the demiurge, planning out creation, but the direct agent of that creation.\nIt is interesting to note the way \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 is used in the three creeds so far. In the Nicene it is attached to the clause \u2018begotten from the Father\u2019, and explained as \u2018from the essence of the Father\u2019. The first Antiochene simply mentions it in apposition to \u2018in one Son of God\u2019, without further explanation. The second Antioch creed not only lacks the Nicene explanation, but introduces \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03bd, so that we have a substantial phrase \u2018the only-begotten God\u2019. The understanding of \u2018God\u2019 here remains unclear, or at least ambiguous, that one might understand the Son to be \u2018God\u2019 in some other way than later trinitarian formulations. Indeed, what is remarkable about the Second Antiochene is not so much what it says, but what it doesn\u2019t say.\nWe then have a substantial section that lists of a series of X from X statements, followed by a catalogue of direct biblical analogies for the Son, mostly derived from John\u2019s Gospel. Finally we have a distinct positive attribution of the relation of Father and Son, in iconic terms. Note that the Son is not only exact image of the Father\u2019s will, power, and glory, but also \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2. These two features, X of X and iconic relation, typify the Eusebian approach to the Father-Son relation. We also see a direct scriptural citation within the body of the Creed, a novel feature that repeats twice more.\nThe economic discription of the Son is likewise expanded from the first creed, though lacking any soteriological purpose clause. The inclusion of Jn 6:38 matches the phrase from the first creed \u201call his father\u2019s will co-fulfilled\u201d, a strong indication of the way the Antiochene counsel wants to firmly align Jesus\u2019 economic fulfilment as the Father\u2019s will. What is left unsaid is the subordinationist tone here, that it is in some sense not Jesus\u2019 independent will of any sort. The anti-Marcellan rider is dropped from the second section.\nThe third section greatly expands, giving a purpose for the Holy Spirit post-Pentecost, and linking this to Mathew 28:19. This inclusion of Matthew 28:19 and the trinitarian baptism formula moves into the second Antiochene creed\u2019s most precise trintitarian formulation. There is an insistence that the phrasing of the verse is intentional and doctrinally significant, that the names indicate three distinct hypostaseis, distinct also in rank and glory. Their unity is one of concord or agreement.\nAt this stage of the development of 4th century terminology, we have here a clear expression of three distinct subsistences, three beings even, who differ in rank and glory, and whose unity is one of will. It is in light of this statement that the rest must be read, because it becomes clear that when they refer to the Son as \u2018the only-begotten God\u2019, they have in mind a distinct being.\nThe fourth section of the credal statement anathematises \u2018every heretical heterodoxy\u2019. Specifically it excludes the idea that there was a temporal gap prior to the generation of the Son. It also excludes that the Son be considered creature, offspring, product as one of the [other] creatures, offsprings, products. Again, what is left unsaid is the possibility of an a-temporal gap between the Son\u2019s generation and the creation, or that the Son be considered a creature, offspring, product not as the others. The very fact that the statements about creature, etc., are given comparative clauses rather than standing absolute suggests this \u2018hermeneutical space\u2019. The creed wraps up with a reaffirmation of the appeal to Scripture as tradition, and anthematises all who teach and preach outside this received faith.\nwhich God also promised through the prophet to pour out upon his own servants, and the Lord promised to send to his own disciples, which he also sent, as the Acts of the Apostles witnesses.\nBut if any teach besides this faith, or holds in himself, let him be anathema; and of Marcellus of Ancyra, of Sabellius, of Paul of Samosata, let him also be anathama, and all in communion with him.\nThe main point to note from Theophronius\u2019 confession is the phrase \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u0398\u03b5\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9. Firstly for the use of hypostasis in this context, which we should read in light of the 2nd Antiochene creed, with an eye to the idea that the two are separate hypostaseis. Secondly, with regard to the choice to say that the Son is with God in hypostasis, rather than that the Son is with the Father. We might also briefly note that the list of anathemas is more specific in terms of naming individual figures, though they are all of a cloth.\nThe 4th Antiochene creed, along with the 2nd, gets the most post-council usage, and so deserves greater attention. Athanasius notes that it was, in his view, due to the deficiency of the earlier formulation, also that the council met with Constantius present, and that the creed was dispatched to Gaul, specifically to bring this to Constans.\nAnd in the Holy Spirit, that is, the Paraclete; which being promised to the apostles, after his ascension into heaven he sent, to teach them and remind them of all; through whom also the souls of those purely believing in him will be sanctified.\nBut those saying the Son was from nothing, or from a difference hypostasis, and not from God, and, there was a time when he was not, the Catholic Church knows as aliens.\nComparing the 4th creed to both the Nicene and the 2nd Antiochene, we note in the first section that \u2018demiurge\u2019 has been dropped, as has \u2018preserver\u2019, instead adopting the language from Theophronius of Maker and Creator. Additionally they have added a line drawn directly from Ephesians 3:15 relating to universal patria. Regarding the Son, it maintains \u2018begotten, before the ages, of the Father\u2019, adding only \u2018all\u2019 to qualify ages. It significantly reduces the list of \u2018X from X\u2019 statements and scriptural titles for the Son. Also absent is the \u2018exact image\u2019 language. Significantly the 4th adds back in \u2018for us\u2019 from the Nicene to give some soteriological purpose to the Economy. The eschatological elements are expanded considerably, emphasising final judgment, and especially the eternal kingdom and existence of the Son (strongly anti-Marcellan in tone). The purpose of the Spirit is likewise mentioned in both the 4th and the 2nd, though in different terms. The use of \u03b5\u1f30\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c2 is polemical in the sense that it emphases santification for those with a pure, unmixed faith, implying of course that failure to subscribe to this creed is in fact the standard for such a pure faith.\nThe anathemas are repeated from Nicaea, and so butress the position that the Antioch council is deliberately distancing itself from any suggestion of Arianism, even as the creeds themselves contain considerable material directing at Marcellan monarchianism. We see here the Eusebian moderating position situating itself between Arian subordinationism and Sabellian modalism, but it is a strategy that the pro-Nicenes will also adopt, essentially situating themselves more centrally, while marginalising the Eusebian trajectory towards the Arian extremity.\n \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u1ff6\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f40\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1\u03bd; \u1f61\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u1fb3 \u1f15\u03bd.\n i.e. holds a contrary opinion to this faith, but privately and not teaching so."}
{"text":"That darn snake! Too often he gets into our minds and uses what he finds there to cause us problems. It happened to Eve and has continued through history to us. He is like a roaring lion that travels miles to find something to devour. (1 Peter 5:8) In the first part of that verse we are told to be self-controlled and alert. Alert to what? Perhaps our lack of self-control. Read Eve\u2019s story in Genesis 3. She had some self-control issues that we still deal with today. First, how about the fact that we, and Eve, let our words get us into trouble. If she hadn\u2019t spent so much time talking with the snake she wouldn\u2019t have determined that she was perhaps missing something. God didn\u2019t create us with two ears and one mouth for no reason. He wants us listening carefully, He wants us being careful about what we listen too, and He wants us to simply close our mouths to unnecessary conversation.\nIt also seems that we, and Eve, have a really big problem with coveting that which belongs to another. There is a commandment about that. We really aren\u2019t supposed to get ourselves wrapped up in what others around us have. Jesus tells us plainly that the Father provides what we need and we need to be careful that we are not wanting more than He thinks we should have.\nLastly, we eat to much. This is both a physical and figurative statement. We certainly need real food, in appropriate proportions to nourish the body and keep us healthy. We also need to be ravenous for the food that is provided in a daily diet of God\u2019s Word. He will feed our hunger for the answers to life\u2019s questions if we take the time to learn what he wants for us.\nAwesome and mighty Heavenly Father, You alone are worthy of my praise. Father control me. Control my words, my wants and make me ravenous for Your Word. Make it so!\nThis entry was posted in Faith, Fellowship with God, Mouth, Personal Growth and tagged Eve, Genesis by Marie. Bookmark the permalink.\nHi Marie, thank you for your message we do indeed need God\u2019s Spiritual food.\nHow do we know what God wants for us, how do we know His heart, the Scriptures below clearly tell us, do we lack God\u2019s wisdom and so not understand them, then He tells us to ask and we will receive. Eve was deceived into disobeying God, Adam chose to disobey and listened to Eve, which one is true of us or have we found the key.\nThanks Anne, I hope others read your comments. There\u2019s always good words there."}

We love a challenge and our Barre classes are certainly that, but we encourage everyone to try them \u2013 don\u2019t worry, we have a few tricks up our sleeve if things get tough! Join us today and start to lead your healthiest, happiest life.\nI joined Flex Body in December 2016 after three years at a larger studio in Crows Nest, and have never looked back. It has been terrific since day 1. The wide range of classes has exposed me to different exercises and challenges that have benefited my overall well-being. Until joining Flex Body, I had not tried Pilates, which I have found very enjoyable and great for the core. What keeps me coming back is simple: the high quality of instructors, the variety of Yoga and Pilates classes, the wide range of sessions, the small class sizes that maximise instructor-student interaction and the friendly atmosphere. The Yoga and Pilates in particular have been helpful in my Karate training, and especially for those past youth, Yoga and Pilates definitely help keep the body in peak form. Another factor is the available membership linkage with my gym, Anytime Fitness Northbridge, which is conveniently located in the same building. I now feel full of energy, fit, healthy, and strong, with the Yoga and Pilates classes certainly a big help.\nSince joining Flex Body I have made a marvelous and timely revelation about the care and cultivation of one's muscles. It's never too late to learn about this. I love the cheerful, unforced atmosphere, personal attention, weekly improvement and it's fun! My lower back is now no longer my enemy and my stamina for physical tasks has vastly increased.\nI was recently recommended to try out Flex Body in Northbridge by a friend and glad I did. After my two week free trial, I committed to a yearly affordable membership. Flexible times, great choice of classes, along with friendly welcoming staff and instructors, it's a hidden gem!\nAnita and her amazing team are a big part of what has kept me coming back. Everyone always has time for a chat and to give me tips on how to improve my practice. I don\u2019t ever feel like I am being judged for what I can or can\u2019t do \u2013 it is an incredibly supportive community! Also after never having tried yoga before (I was a total cardio junkie) now I find I can\u2019t live without it! Before I started at Flex Body I was seeing the osteo for back pain on a weekly basis. Since going to yoga and Pilates on a regular basis I haven\u2019t had to see the osteo in 4 months. My back (and my wallet) feel fantastic. I have also noticed a change in my body shape from weekly yoga, Pilates and barre classes.\nI love the huge variety of classes, the brand new air-conditioned studio and the lovely and helpful instructors which makes coming along so enjoyable. It can be a full on 50 mins but it's all worth it by the time you walk out! The super friendly welcome I get every time I walk in the door, be it 5.45am or 7pm! Plus, I like to keep improving in my practice and I always feel challenged in each class Since starting after my second bub, I'm feeling stronger, fitter and getting noticeable results.\nI have absolutely LOVED having yoga, pilates and barre options in Northbridge. I can walk to FlexBody and there are so many class options, which suits me well. It is the only studio with a lunch class. The studio is beautiful and all the equipment and equipment options are of the highest level. The instructors mix it up weekly which keeps the classes interesting - they also focus on different areas, so you are constantly learning more about your body and also concentrating on doing it right. Having been a participant in large format exercise classes, I know that a lot of students are consistently doing moves incorrectly and damaging the body over time (particularly me). The smaller class format means instructors are constantly coming around and correcting students. This is key for me. I also love the flexibility and the fact that the facility is clean and new. No question that I feel healthier and stronger - have more flexibility and having such close access to Flexbody means I am going to classes more regularly and have all those wonderful endorphins releasing more often! Muscle tone has improved and I'm happier.\nWe bring experience, passion and integrity to each class and ensure you walk out feeling a million dollars!\nAfter teaching Pilates for 8 years, Sharon attended her first Barre class in 2015 and she fell in love with the program.

With Olivia you'll experience the delights of yoga through a fun and playful class.\nAnita has enjoyed a passion for yoga for the past 20 years, finding in this ancient practice the grounding necessary to balance a busy career in London and more recently, work and family life in Sydney. Yoga has provided her with not only the opportunity to improve her flexibility, strength and manage her scoliosis but to deal with the stress and pressure of daily life. As a result, several years ago she decided to take this passion further and completed her Yoga teacher training, then more recently her Pilates qualification, with a view to opening the kind of studio she had always been seeking. So she created that place. ``It is somewhere for people to share a wonderful, supportive class with experienced and uplifting instructors``. A place that changes lives. A place called Flex Body.\nGrowing up as a country girl, Yvette embodies a grounded attitude through her work in the fitness industry.

{"text":"Baltimore will host the CIAA Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Basketball Tournaments beginning in 2021, the conference announced today after news broke yesterday afternoon on HBCU Gameday.\nCharm City beat out incumbent host city Charlotte and Norfolk for the right to host one of the nation\u2019s most popular college sporting events, which in recent years has grossed an average of $50 million in economic impact for the Queen City and businesses in its metropolitan footprint.\nConference officials seemingly grew weary of the hotel price gouging, latent racism and bad financials of its deal with Charlotte and made good on a threat to move it to a city where Carolina-based fans may protest the new mileage required to get to everything but a CIAA basketball game, but where once-distant fans from the Philadelphia-DC-Richmond corridor may feel more at home.\nThe CIAA Tournament, like the Bayou Classic, has unfairly become an annual referendum on the value of HBCU athletics based upon fan attendance, corporate sponsorship dollars and buzz in traditional and social media. Without all of these things, the tournament still draws thousands of people and adds much gravitas to the tourism profile of whatever city hosts the event.\nNorthern-based HBCU basketball fans have to learn lessons from the spoiled and coddled fans in North Carolina, who for 13 years enjoyed the high life of the CIAA Tournament social orbit, but who never drove the tournament\u2019s brand as an actual athletic event despite most of the participating schools being in the State of North Carolina.\nThose fans won\u2019t be coming to Baltimore; they\u2019ll say it will be too far to go, too cold to visit in February, and not as much fun as Charlotte. All of those things may be legitimate points for everyone below Petersburg, Va., but not for everyone above it. And for everyone who is all-in for a black college basketball tournament within a two-hour drive of several major cities, the onus is on them to actually fill the Royal Farms Arena to help the conference maintain its swag as a lightning rod for companies looking to sell products and goodwill to educated, affluent black people.\nThe City of Baltimore also has to learn lessons from Charlotte\u2019s mistakes in handling the CIAA Tournament. The CIAA is looking for partnership in controlling hotel room rates, limiting opportunities for independent party promoters to throw CIAA-branded parties without licensing or permission, and to support in-arena engagement opportunities. Missing work in these areas will make the two-year deal with the CIAA a limited-run show.\nAnd when they aren\u2019t watching the games, they have to make the Inner Harbor and downtown social areas as lit as Charlotte annually appeared on Instagram and Facebook.\nThis will be the first time in more than a decade where the CIAA Tournament will reclaim the opportunity to build interest not only with geographically distant alumni of CIAA schools, but also with graduates former CIAA schools like Morgan State and Hampton, and SWAC alumni now living and working in the mid-Atlantic but who do not travel to Mississippi, Houston, Atlanta or New Orleans for major conference games and tournaments.\nMoving to Baltimore gives the CIAA a chance to evolve as a national event for all HBCU students and alumni, something that the tournament lost in the glitz of its run in Charlotte. The new city may not give everyone the late winter getaway they want, but it will give the conference a chance to rediscover what its basketball tournament should have always been; a showcase of HBCU talent and black buying power that just happens to give way to decent bars and clubs once the games are over, and not the other way around.\nThe area isn\u2019t going to make people attend the games. Most young people go to party. I myself will not go to Baltimore! Not a good site.\nOnly 1 school in that area! The city is not a good spot. Not happy! I\u2019ve gone every year since they came to Charlotte. I can\u2019t see their hotel prices being any better. I\u2019ve attended a conference there and the prices and parking were way higher. I will pass on Baltimore!\nI can understand that from a tourist perspective. I do not understand it from a basketball perspective, which is what the conference\u2019s approach is and what we as fans should want. Baltimore gave the conference more money for scholarships, and the basketball arena rent-free. This helps the member schools to keep more of the money they yield respectively from the tournament. I hope most fans don\u2019t take the position that they won\u2019t support it because it is seemingly not as good of a vacation spot as Charlotte, because Charlotte was not a good supporting partner of our schools.\nGreat move. If you check enrollment over 70% of HBCU students come from out of a northern state. The new location will be able to reach more of these future students and alum. Parking and hotel prices will be high but you will have more choices than was available in Charlotte. Attendance may drop for the first few nights but championship Saturday will be packed.\nCIAA students and alumni should give it a shot to see how the City of Baltimore responds to the huge influx of fans coming to Charm City to have fun, enjoy basketball and great crab cakes. Hopefully, the City will educate their police force and they will protect and not provoke problems. There have been some great AA Conferences and activities in Baltimore, with lots of music and fun,and black folks enjoyed themselves. There is lot to do in the Baltimore area, and if not go to DC and the African American Museum."}
{"text":"In Douglas Adam\u2019s 5-book trilogy, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide the Galaxy, there\u2019s a running gag about the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.\nThe characters find out that the Answer is 42.\nBut Adams also posits that the Answer and the Question are mutually exclusive. If you know one, you can\u2019t know the other. So nobody can figure out what the actual question is.\nCompassion is incredibly important. Compassion towards others, towards the planet, and towards yourself. When things are mucked up, there\u2019s usually a dearth of compassion to blame. And that\u2019s because compassion can be hard. It often requires us to show up as our best self, which is challenging. But if you spend your days trying to act compassionately, you\u2019ll have a life well spent.\nYour definition of success has to be your own. It should be open and evolving, but in the end it has to be yours. Lots of people and groups will try to tell you what success is, because then they can tell you how to act to achieve that success. Simply take the pieces that resonate, and then politely say \u201cno thank you\u201d to the rest.\nLearn how to appreciate jazz and poetry. They will reward the effort you put into them.\nThe people that surround you will shape your perspective on life. Not intentionally, but they will. You hang around high-drama people, you\u2019ll have a high-drama life. You hang around smart, generous people, you\u2019ll have a much more relaxed life. And the best way to attract good people: be one first and then treat them like gold when they arrive into your life.\nThe world is not fair. Sometimes it will come out in your favor and sometimes it won\u2019t. Don\u2019t get cocky when it goes your way or bitter when it doesn\u2019t because neither of those is helpful.\nConsistently make new friends. Not to replace your existing friends, but to add to the mix. Making friends takes time and energy, which is why a lot of people give up on it as they get older. But you\u2019ll continue to run into good people throughout your life, and showing those relationships a little attention can lead to wonderful opportunities and experiences.\nNo one gets out of this thing alive. That is an irrevocable truth. You can decide whether that makes you fearful or appreciative. I suggest the later.\nTrust and respect are both earned, not given. If you want to have people\u2019s trust and respect, you have to act in a way that engenders it. If you do so, and they still don\u2019t trust and respect you, that\u2019s on them, not you. Don\u2019t spend time worrying about it.\nHave high expectations for your growth as a person. Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you haven\u2019t achieved a specific goal by a specific time. But always ask yourself, \u201cHave I grown and matured from where I was last week, last month, or last year?\u201d The only person you have to compare yourself to is the you of yesterday.\nStudy rhetoric. It\u2019s a powerful mix of logic, communication, and philosophy. It will guide your inner dialogue, clarify your communication with others, and protect you from disingenuous marketing and political hacks.\nFind the right partner. It\u2019s a cliche that who you decide to marry is the most important decision you make because it\u2019s true. Wait for the right person, and be sure that you are the right person for them. You\u2019ll probably go through some broken hearts and some almost-rights. They won\u2019t kill you (although it might feel like it). Make the decision because you want to be with that person, not because you are afraid of not being with them.\nEat food from different cultures. And listen to their music. We all eat and we all dance and it\u2019s a great way to get to know the world. Plus, you\u2019ll eat some amazing food and listen to some great music.\nHave books everywhere. On bookshelves, by the bed, in the bathroom, on your phone, in your backpack. And read them. Everything from science fiction to literature to business to psychology to spirituality to comics. Books are the cheapest and fastest route to understanding the world around you.\nCall your mother. She went through a lot to get you here. She\u2019d love to hear from you, even if it\u2019s just to say hello."}
{"text":"Can your parenting schedule impact how much child support is paid?\nAn amount that is specific to \u201cspecial and extraordinary expenses\u201d. This post will focus only on the basic amount. You can learn more about special and extraordinary expenses here.\nIn simple cases, child support can be calculated by determining the Guideline amount. In complex matters, the Guideline amount can be used as a starting point.\nYou have a sole custody arrangement if your child spends at least 60 percent of their time with you over the course of a year. In this situation, your co-parent will pay the full Guideline amount. You can find out Guideline amounts with this online calculator.\nYou have a shared custody arrangement if your child spends equal time (no less than 40 percent of their time) with both parents over the course of the year. In this case, child support is often determined by a \u201cset-off\u201d amount. To determine the set-off amount, you will need to locate the amount of child support payable based on both parents\u2019 gross annual incomes. Subtract the smaller Guideline amount from the larger Guideline amount. The resulting payment is called the \u201cset-off\u201d, and the parent with the higher gross annual income will have to pay this amount to the other parent.\nSection 9 of the Guidelines gives judges discretion to order something other than the Table amount in shared custody cases. It is common for judges to use a \u201cset-off\u201d but they are not required to do so. They may order more or less than the \u201cset-off\u201d amount depending on the circumstances of your case.\nYou have a split custody arrangement if you have two or more children and each parent has sole custody of at least one of them. For example, you may have two children and one lives primarily with you while the other child lives primarily with the other parent. In this case, each parent has to pay support according to the Guidelines for any children living with the other parent. The parent who has to pay the higher amount must pay the difference to the other parent.\nThe overarching rule for seeking a change in child support is the existence of a \u2018material change in circumstance\u2019. Generally, this will require a change in parental income, custody or your child's level of dependency. For instance, if your child is heading off to university, you may wish to request a change in support to address the extraordinary expense of tuition or because the child will be living in residence or in their own apartment. You can learn more about varying child support here."}

{"text":"REVIEW | Fierce Iconoclasm: Cameron Yates's \"The Canal Street Madam\"\nJeanette Maier, the firecracker featured in Cameron Yates\u2019s \u201cThe Canal Street Madam,\u201d is a natural screen presence: The once-powerful overseer of a popular New Orleans brothel, she exudes old fashioned charm while maintaining a seductive aura and a filthy mouth. But she\u2019s also defined by the courage of her convictions, even when they seem unclear.\nMaier, whose eponymous brothel operated successfully from 1999 to 2001 until an FBI bust landed her three years of probation and a series of other convictions, refuses to back down from the nature of her reputation. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a whore,\u201d she says, with a powerful degree of self-confidence that might even lead some feminists to give her a pass.\nBut even as Maier commands the screen in Yates\u2019s verite collage of scenes from her recent life, the director only gives us glimpses of her entire story. \u201cThe Canal Street Madam\u201d is composed of scenes in which Maier and her family discuss her uneven personal life, in addition to those in which she basks in the spotlight of her provocations during public appearances. Since we learn very little about Maier\u2019s descent into the world of prostitution (she recalls being sexually abused by her uncle, leaving the psychoanalysis up to viewers), she only exists as the sum of her experiences. Much of her appeal (or lack thereof) in recent New Orleans history is taken for granted, which can create a distancing effect for viewers unfamiliar with her plight.\nNevertheless, \u201cThe Canal Street Madam\u201d remains singularly engaging for the way that Yates manages to draw a contrast between her public image and tattered personal life. His camera captures intimate familial disputes (including a scene in which she discovers one of her grown sons taking heroin) and her stop-and-start impoverished lifestyle. Her legacy hides a deeper, more tragic reality \u2014 although the extent to which she suffers from her libidinous ways never fully emerges.\nYates depicts his subject as a figure of fierce iconoclasm, which is another way of saying that the movie generally feels slanted in her favor, sometimes to the detriment of the movie\u2019s credibility as a straight verite portrait. On television, Maier never hesitates to remind the public of her pride. She calls prostitution \u201ca victimless crime,\u201d leaving us to wonder if she\u2019s unaware of the damage that her seedy tendencies have obviously afflicted on her family. Her children berate her for routinely making incendiary remarks in the media, establishing an argument over whether her relaxed use of the word \u201cwhore\u201d hurts or helps her publicity. The answer is the ultimate paradox at the core of the Madam\u2019s persona."}
{"text":"That means the program's version 2.3 is in a package that is called \"whatever\", and this is the second version of the package (hence the -2) offered by the packager. It is intended for a 32 bit Intel 386 (or better) system.\nNotice that's almost the same as the RedHat style, except the suffix is deb.\nAlmost all Linux distributions currently in use are descended from either RedHat or Debian.\nSlackware Linux uses its own package system, but I've not used Slackware since 1997, and don't have anything to say about it.\nAll of the major Linux distributions have tried to make it easier and easier to 1) get all the packages you need and 2) install the pre-requisites and 3) stop you from removing something that is required for something else. The \"basic program\" that administers the package system is a command line tool, such as \"rpm\" on RedHat or \"dpkg\" on Debian, and then layered \"on top\" of that we have the \"yum\" program on RedHat and \"apt-get\" on Debian systems. \"yum\" and \"apt-get\" are network aware and if one asks to install a package, they attempt to find out what else might be needed and download that at the same time.\nWhen I started this, I had more energy than I do now. I should come back with a more comprehensive list of rpm and dpkg command options. They are quite powerful.\nThe term \"dependency hell\" refers to the difficulty of installing a package that somebody else builds against their system when one's system is slightly different. When programs are compiled, they use \"shared libraries\" and those libraries may be slightly different on the build system, and so the install system might experience trouble because it does not have access to those libraries.\nMost of my experience is with the RPM system, and I have to admit I still think it is superior to the DEB packaging framework, but the differences are all in the packager's work, not on the user end. Users seem to think the DEB system is better, more convenient, but the RedHat system has been fine for me. That being said, on my personal computers--my laptop--I currently run Ubuntu Linux, a Debian derivative. That choice was driven by the need for 3D video drivers. At the new user level, the predominant opinion seems to be that a Debian system, particularly the Ubuntu Linux distribution, makes it easier to get out of \"dependency hell\".\nFirst of all, realize that not all Linux distributions will have the same assumptions about security. Some are configured in a way that is easy for newcomers, and therefore possibly less secure. Some are configured for experts, thus allowing newcomers to accidentally open up their systems to abuses.\nIn the \"olden days,\" the default Linux installation would create 7 or so partitions on the hard disk, and it would put the major components in separate partitions. It was difficult\/impossible to \"resize\" a partition, and even today that is somewhat untrustworthy on any OS. Sometimes, it is necessary for me to refer to these old school notes on Copying a File System Entirely."}
{"text":"I was reading an editorial by the former publisher of the National Review endorsing Barack Obama. It was interesting. But this is not a political post.\nThat struck a cord with me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but my gut suspects that it is. I\u2019ve seen the \u201cgreat cause\u201d of independent role-playing games go from a movement to a business. Is there any way to fight human nature and the lessons of history and stop it from becoming a racket?\nAnytime a single product or company becomes a Business and Makes Money, it runs the risk of becoming a Racket.\nKeep new blood, both creative and consuming, coming into the \u201cindustry\u201d \u2013 keep the ideas new and make sure each new \u201cgeneration\u201d views the \u201cmovement\u201d as their own \u2013 suffer gladly when they wave it around as though they are, in fact, inventing the wheel.\n1) There\u2019s no need to worry, since they aren\u2019t really a great cause.\n2) There\u2019s no need to worry, because they aren\u2019t really a business.\n3) There\u2019s no need to worry, because truly vibrant communities, whatever activity they surround, can contain all of these stages (and many more) at once, each in their own ecological niches, each provoking reaction and evolution in the other, and the more such activity, the more product gets made, and the more variety of product, and the more of it that you (whatever your tastes) would enjoy.\nI think that was a slightly \u2026 bitchier version of exactly what I said.\nOne SINGLE game or company might become a racket. But the chances of the whole genre\/industry\/movement becoming a racket, and there being no new blood following behind to freshen the pool? Unlikely.\nThings becoming a business I don\u2019t mind, so long as its a business with a soul. Partly, I think, because in that step between business and racket is a place where the business shifts within itself.\nIn Indie Land I think things like Jonathan\u2019s move to make games free is something that could help, but the question is if it\u2019ll be something that gets pull, due to the status given to published for money products, and the problems with investment (time and self) and the capitalist systems logic that those be returned (with money, of course).\nThe Ashcan front often seems to get right into this tricky kind of ground, with the intent heavily towards movement, but the sheer logistics of the actuality necessitating some level of business. As folks point out, if you give away a physical ashcan it costs you money, and if you give it away physically or electronically it may mean that fewer people play it because it didn\u2019t cost them.\nAnd really, that\u2019s the rub. If you make distributing games a movement in modern North America you may have problems getting people to actually play your games, where those who are doing it as a business will have folks with money in hand lined up at their booth.\nI think it\u2019s not \u201cGreat causes\u201d, it\u2019s funny.\nYou\u2019re small and don\u2019t do what other people do, so you have to kick up noise, you have to kick things up, you have to do something worthy of attention.\nThen you become an average guy (on average), and you become complacent.\nAnd if you don\u2019t go up, or renew, eventually you\u2019ll decline.\nOne reason for complacency is fear. When you had nothing, you didn\u2019t fear losing it. Now that you perceive yourself to have something, you fear losing it."}

{"text":"A harbour view is framed through the gap between the two sides of this house in Massachusetts by New York firm Leroy Street Studio. Cove House extends across a sea-facing slope in Woods Hole, a coastal town in the south of the state, overlooking the Vineyard Sound. Leroy Street Studio designed the home as a modern adaptation of the historic shingle-covered buildings found in the area.\n\u201cThe Cove House embodies the client\u2019s desire for a contemporary house that is deferential to the New England vernacular,\u201d said the architects, which also recently completed two houses on Long Island.\nThe building is split into two, with the separate sections positioned at slightly different angles towards the sea. They are buried into the hillside, so they are less imposing from the street but open up fully to the ocean, and are linked below grade. Both sides are two storeys high, although one is a touch taller than the other so their gabled roofs can overlap.\nThe pair of buildings accommodate different functions. All the bedrooms are situated in the northern block, with the master suite and two guest rooms at entry level, and three kids bedrooms and staff quarters below.\nAn assortment of spaces for lounging, dining, cooking, reading and exercising are distributed across the two floors in the south section. Small level changes help to define the different areas, and help the home align with the terrain. Concrete fireplaces and columns for staircase anchors form focal points through the interiors, which also feature wooden flooring and internal partitions.\nAmple glazing on the sea facade maximises views of the boats, while shingles made from Alaskan yellow cedar clad the street elevation.

{"text":"Is a Financial Aftershock Headed Our Way?\nThe debt crisis that has rocked Greece and much of Europe is a wake-up call for policymakers and investors not only overseas but also in the US.\nThe warning that should not be ignored: Nations can\u2019t keep spending more than they take in without suffering painful consequences \u2014 to economies and investors. If they do, their government debt gets downgraded and the cost of financing that debt soars. Policymakers often wait until it\u2019s too late to head off a crisis.\nDespite a $1 trillion rescue package for Greece from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, the current crisis has shaken global markets. And it is likely to hurt economies around the globe for months and even years as many debt-ridden European countries are forced to adopt austerity programs or face financial instability.\nAs debt-burdened European economies remain sluggish, US export sales to Europe will be anemic, especially at a time when the rising value of the US dollar in relation to the euro has made those exports much less of a bargain. That is a big negative because much of the recent growth fueling a solid recovery in the US economy has come from overseas sales of manufactured goods, and Europe accounts for 20% of US exports.\nCompounding the problem is that export sales also could slow to Asia, a big customer for US goods \u2014 but for different reasons. China\u2019s economy has been booming, with that nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growing at a nearly 12% rate in the first quarter of 2010. Now Chinese policymakers are trying to dampen inflation by cooling down the red-hot economy and by reducing credit to businesses and individuals to limit borrowing. As a result, demand in China \u2014 the third-largest economy in the world \u2014 for exports from other countries will likely decline. With export sales to Europe and Asia softening, US economic growth will be muted. After growing by 5.6% in the fourth quarter of 2009, GDP is slipping this year to a growth rate of near 3% for 2010 and less in 2011. That is much weaker than the typical growth rate that followed most earlier recessions.\nWith the economy growing slowly, employment will pick up only slightly. The US will add about 150,000 jobs a month this year, not including census workers. That is an improvement from last year when jobs were vanishing and the unemployment rate rose above 10%. But the growth in jobs will barely be fast enough to absorb the new people who are constantly entering the workforce. As a result, the unemployment rate will decline only gradually, dropping from the recent figure of 9.9% down to 9.5% by the end of this year and slightly below 9% in 2011.\nTo appreciate how weak the US job market will remain, it is important to consider the underemployment rate, which is currently near 17%. In addition to the unemployed, the underemployment rate includes those who are forced to work part-time or who have stopped looking for work, possibly because of frustration and pessimism. At best, the underemployment rate might drop to 14% in 2011, still about double the rate of two years ago.\nFaced with unemployment and the fear of unemployment, consumers will be wary of spending. Sales of cars and homes will remain weak. Consumer spending will continue growing at a sluggish rate, well below the historical trend of 3.5%.\nOne bright spot will be corporate profits. Earnings of companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index likely will climb at a spectacular rate of 25% this year and a solid 10% to 15% in early 2011, before slowing later in 2011 and 2012. The gains are partly due to the growing US economy, which is pushing up corporate sales. In addition, companies have been aggressively fattening their bottom lines by cutting costs dramatically.\nThe strong earnings growth will provide some support for the stock market. But the risks to profits emanating from the European crisis and the Asian slowdown create conditions for stock market setbacks, including a substantial \u201ccorrection\u201d in the US and abroad that could take the S&P 500 to 1,000 or below, where it hasn\u2019t been since September 2009. Later this year, I expect the S&P 500 to climb back up to around 1,200, a gain of perhaps 7.6% for 2010 and about even with this year\u2019s highest closing price so far of 1,217 on April 23. By mid-2011, I expect the S&P 500 to rise to about 1,350.\nSavers, who have grown weary of minuscule yields on money-market funds, should get some relief when the Federal Reserve starts raising short-term interest rates, probably in 2011 rather than this year. Rates on 10-year Treasury securities likely will climb from the recent level of 3.3% to around 4% in 2011. These rates still will be far too low to lure investors away from stocks and materially weaken the stock market. Complicating the outlook for the global economy, European nations will be forced to pay higher interest rates on their debt as investors see greater risk in their bonds, especially if nations such as Portugal, Spain and Italy are forced to seek rescue packages similar to that of Greece.\nFor the long run, stock investors should give extra weight to information technology companies, including producers of computer hardware and software. These companies are continuing to report strong sales in the US and abroad. Also consider companies that sell consumer staples, such as food and beverages. Those reliable performers are likely to enjoy steadily growing sales.\nWith the US and Europe growing only slowly and financial markets in disarray, for the long run investors should focus more than they usually do on Asian stocks and mutual funds, even with China\u2019s attempts to slow growth. Having avoided most of the problems of the credit crisis, Asia should come out of this in relatively good shape."}

{"text":"A warm winter day, perfect for a quick check.\nA nice strong colony covering 6 frames.\nTom D. checked his bees today. The weather was perfect. He did a quick check. Pulled off the winter cover. Lifting the top box slightly he said they felt heavy. This was a great observation. A lot of food for the masses. The bees will start rearing brood anytime now. His hives are in good shape for late winter getting ready for the spring build up.\nMore Cold Weather, is Starvation Lurking in the Colony?\nOur second cold blast is here. The nice break from the last one gave the bees a chance to reposition in the hive to hopefully be on more honey. Starvation occurs if the bees get caught on frames that the honey has been consumed. Cold weather keeps the bees from moving to other frames of honey. So starvation can occur with honey near the cluster of bees.\nBees in winter use about 12 - 14 lbs of honey per month about 1-1\/4 frames. As we get into Feb. this consumption of food will rise. Starvation in Feb is very common if there is subzero temps for more than 2 - 3 days. At this time brood is being raised and the bees will not abandon the brood. Honey is consumed around the brood to keep it warm, around 95 degrees F. The subzero temps increase the honey use. The cold keeps the cluster of bees tight and prevents the bees from retrieving honey from nearby frames leading to starvation.\nAs a beekeeper there is not much that can be done. Feeding is difficult in Feb. Sugar put on top of the colony can keep a hive from starving but frames of honey is better.\nOn a warm day temps in the 20's a hive can be opened, a quick glance. If there is no capped honey near the cluster a frame can be added or moved next to the cluster. Do not disrupt the cluster.\ne-mail me if you want me to send you an order form.\nI can't leave my e-mail here as spammers will pick it up.\nI am still waiting on 2009 pricing on package bees. I am hoping to have pricing soon.\n1. Evidence of bees flight from the colony on sunny days like dead bees in fresh snow cover in front of hive.\n2. Check for the presence of a frost ring around the top entrance of the colony. Frost ring present means hive is alive.\nI got a e-mail today from someone that had two dead colonies. Some questions come to mind.\nDid you look deep enough into the hive to make sure they are dead? This time of year bees are still below the top box. Looking deep is required. In a 3 box colony that has alot of food the bees may be in the bottom box.\nIf the hive is really dead the question is why. On a sunny day a hive can be taken apart and cleaned out if it is dead. Look for the cluster of bees. Did they starve? No honey around the cluster and bee bodies stuck in the cells with their butts looking at you is the sign of starvation. Even if there was frames of honey nearby they couldn't get there and starved.\nNosema Ceranae. This is a newer disease and could be part of the CCD problem. We are mostly familiar with Nosema Apis. Nosema Apis is predictable, it would surface in March and or April then go away. It wouldn't always kill a colony. Nosema Ceranae can happen at any time of year. It affects the ability of older bees to feed. The colony will start to dwindle and eventually will perish. Both Nosemas' respond well to a treatment regimen of fumigillan. In this gentleman's case he had one weak colony going into winter. This could have been dwindling from Nosema Cerane and the other colony got infected as well.\nVarroa Destructor. This mite has caused headache since its arrival. Failure to treat for Varroa in early fall can weaken the colony as the Varroa level builds up. With the increased mite load, viruses can come out that would normally lay dormant in the bees.\nWhat to do is simple. Beekeeping runs on a calender for the most part. Doing treatments at certain times of the year is the key for success. Treating at the wrong time many times does very little for colony survival.\nStrong colonies, ample food, proper hive location, winter covers with moisture release boards are the basic things needed for wintering.\nFumigilan and Varroa Treatment in late August is the key to successful wintering. Doing these simple tasks at the right time will help assure of bees buzzing in the spring."}
{"text":"March 9. Last here in August 2018 Stonecold Country made an early return as they were available at short notice standing in for our scheduled act who were double booked. I was away and have compiled this report from notes sent to me.\nFather and son duo, Ray and Steve Kedge, were on top form and had the dancers up from the start. An early song, Dangerous Curves, featured some great guitar work from Steve. Ray (vocals\/steel guitar) and Steve complemented each other all evening with their singing and instrumentation.\nThey performed Kiss the Girl, a Disney song from the film\/show The Little Mermaid, which to me is a catchy and pleasant song to listen\/dance to and yet across the Atlantic some have branded the lyrics sexist and misogynistic. As usual, Steve played a guitar solo and this time it was Ghost Riders In the Sky which club host Mary rated the best so far. Another song of note was Call Me When It\u2019s Over written by local country singer\/songwriter Billy Levin and you can see Stonecold Country singing this on YouTube.\nThey closed the evening with Gary Perkin\u2019s Thank You which seemed appropriate as those present left thanking them for a great evening\u2019s entertainment and the best they have heard from Stonecold Country."}

{"text":"It seems I have been taking my sweet time in updating this blog of mine\u2026 Well, I was full of good intentions but it seems that time is just flying and that I can\u2019t find much of it to complete the blog. So, here is what I will be doing below. I will be listing all the previous projects I have completed in chronological order. I don\u2019t have the exact dates for each as these projects span about 15 years. I\u2019ll put the years when I remember them.\nThis was my very first \u201cserious\u201d project to start making my own furniture. I only had a brand new bought table saw, the same I still own today \u2013 the Ridgid 10\u201d. Everything for these pieces was done on that table saw. Again, this was my first serious project and I had not learned the famous \u201cmeasure twice, cut once\u201d rule. I therefore cut much more than once. I have to say that I learned quickly from the first few mistakes not to trust myself and take my time in measuring and cutting wood. You can see the major mistake in the lower drawer of the top chest not being the same size as the others. Essentially, of course, all three drawers were supposed to be the same size. Well, I\u2019ll pretend that this was my design choice and we\u2019ll leave it at that!\nThis piece of furniture was fairly big and unwieldy to work on. I\u2019m happy to say that I had my father\u2019s help on this one as, alone, it would not have been pretty. Fortunately, I had decided not to glue and screw some pieces in the armoire. I say fortunately because the weight of the thing was impressive with everything included. The box of drawers inside was removed as well as the top and doors.\nThe hinges I bought should not have been used on this piece of furniture. They are hanging hinges and I need to lift the doors to remove them making this an impossible process when you consider that the top actually overhangs the doors. So, once I completed it including varnish, everything was screwed in place and the doors were no longer coming off.\nEmpty garage of the new house.\nThese side tables were a fun little project to build. There were new techniques for me to learn and apply. The fun part was that I was making 4 in total. Two for me and two for my best friend. There isn\u2019t much to say about these. Everything was pretty straightforward in the build. I took my time and they turned out great.\nThe original plan for this coffee table was to use it as a working desk. However, the height of my couch is not enough for the height of the table once open. Build was fairly straightforward with nothing of note to mention. The only problem that is dogging me to this day is making proper 45-degree cuts! I can\u2019t seem to ever get these correct whatever I try.\nI have stained this piece the same color that I used for the nightstand tables and bed. You can see that color here with my then baby (3 months old) Weimaraner, Kimiko.\nAs my woodworking was progressing apace, I was ending up with lots of smaller parts that I didn\u2019t want to throw out \u201cjust in case\u2026\u201d I saw this in ShopNotes and decided to build it. I had a friend help me who was not used to woodworking and to whom the rule, nay, law, \u201cmeasure twice, cut once\u201d was unknown. We had fun as I would argue that some things seemed crooked and he\u2019s assure me that they were straight and I\u2019d challenge him to recalculate and he\u2019d see there were actually mistakes. There was also my workbench that we built together that fit together magically however many mistakes we made. We\u2019re still wondering how it actually all lined up properly. Well, I imagine that if you rout enough dadoes, you get a few that are ultimately aligned! I\u2019m not showing that masterpiece but you can see it in the background of some pictures.\nSo, the wood station was put on big casters, as I need to have everything on wheels, as it is a garage that actually gets used for putting cars in as well as motorcycles at that time. It served its purpose well until I changed houses and had less space. It was destroyed and the wood reused where possible. Such is life.\nThis was the most challenging work I had done so far in my woodworking hobby career. There were a number of complications that I had never done before but the plans were clear and brilliantly made, especially for the lats. That was just brilliant and made everything much easier to assemble. The pictures show how it was done. For this project, I \u201chad\u201d to buy a few tools that have served me faithfully ever since.\nMaking the jig for the routing was a challenge in itself as it was incredibly important that everything be straight. I bought a new router kit \u2013 it came with a fixed and plunge base.\nI then made the lats but they were slightly too proud so had to be put on the jointer to thin. Yes, you did see a brand new DeWalt planer in the background. This piece of equipment actually was taken out and used only about 3 years ago\u2026 for my home office project.\nA friend introduced me to a high end furniture store and I saw this type of desk. I was quite impressed by it and the fact that it was very minimalist and clean lines. This is what I like in the furniture I build. I used the pictures I could see on the website and made the design in SketchUp. I had no idea of the actual size and thickness of the wood used so let\u2019s just say that I over-engineered it. The vertical posts are 1.5\u201d thick. This is being held up by a top cross beam that is bolted in the wall studs. The three posts hang off of this via a 45-degree cut in. I later went to the store and had a look at the actual desk. The original size of the posts is 5\/8\u201d\u2026 Mine is sturdy! \ud83d\ude09 The shelves slide in grooves cut into the posts and are held there by this over only 3\u201d.\nThe desk is somewhat larger and deeper than the original design. I was thinking of adding small front legs to it but decided against it. I wanted to see how it would hold up. It\u2019s holding up very well after a few years of use. Both desks are being used on a daily basis as we work from home.\nI have build these custom made cabinets and hanging shelves for my best friend\u2019s new house. She had an interior designer come and suggest various things for her to do to in her house\u2019s upper level. Unfortunately, that designer not being a woodworker told my friend that it should be done in MDF\u2026 I hate that stuff. A profound hatred of it.\nI made a design based on what she was telling me she wanted. She had seen my office furniture and really liked the free flow design and this is what she opted for her shelves. As everything \u201cneeded\u201d to be done in MDF, I got a very good dust mask to start working. The whole project took me about 3 months to complete, including the paint job. As payment, she bought me the Fuji Q4 Gold. All the frustration and hatred of working with MDF evaporated when I started using the paint gun. What a complete and utter joy to use. And the speed! I just couldn\u2019t believe it. Extremely fast and easy to use. Gave great coverage and I was able to complete this otherwise very long paint job in about 2 days. This is the tool that I use now for all staining and painting I need to do.\nEpic fail! I need to redo this desk, at least the desk part. Well, it\u2019s out there. I\u2019m really unhappy with this desk. Here is what happened.\nI laminated the boards using the conventional one up, one down configuration to ensure I would not get cupping. The frame was built according to my friend\u2019s wishes and it needed to be very discrete. This meant that there would be pieces of wood that would server as a stretcher across the boards for the desktop. This resulted in an incredible curvature after 12 months of existence\u2026 I need to completely redo the top with the appropriate modifications. I think it will be easy to convince my friend that I need to put additional structures that will make the whole look a bit heavier but much more sturdy and the work surface will stay flat. I\u2019m thinking that I could integrate metal in the cross-members so that it will be smaller but very sturdy.\nSo, that is it for all my past woodworking. I am slowing down on that front a bit as I have all the furniture I need. There may be some things that I will be redoing, for example the electronics and sound system cupboard that I built with crazily warped plywood.\nI am now meddling in DIY electronics! I have built a pre-amplifier and am currently building an amplifier. The B24 from AMB.org. I\u2019ve already built a pair of speakers, the Mini-Statements by Curt\u2019s Speaker Design Works. I am currently building my second pair of speakers, the Ellam Flex 3W from Troels Gravesen. I will post pictures of the build when I am done with them.\nThank you for taking the time to read this and happy holidays!\nThis is the second post of this series. I had promised that I would post regularly on this project\u2026 well, I guess it is once at the beginning and once at the end. I was also talking about procuring a new tool because of this project. Well, this hasn\u2019t materialized yet. I had actually bought the tool, made the payment and then waited for 3 months before being told that the company had \u201clost\u201d a container that contained said tools. I was reimbursed and not told anything about this anymore. I was told by the store where I had bought the tool that I had to call the company directly to know when they would get more tools. Talk about customer service\u2026 Let\u2019s just say that I am reconsidering buying tools and wood from that place in the future. There are quite a few nice places around that actually care about the customer. Maybe it was just that one sales person, as I\u2019ve had run ins with him in the past, maybe it\u2019s the store who has changed over the years. I don\u2019t know but let\u2019s just say that I will diversify in the future. OK, enough of that. The tool seems to be back in stock and still on special so I may still be getting it.\nI have received the wood from the mill. This wood comes from J.T.M. Sawmill in St-Lazare. A lot of wood was ordered for the project and I actually did not add the requisite 20%. I just needed to ensure that I did not make stupid mistakes. Measure twice cut once really applied here. I still made some minor mistakes but these didn\u2019t have a big impact overall. More on that later.\nWhen I ordered the wood, I was told that there would be a two weeks production delay. I then received the wood on time, considering I had to physically go there to inquire as my messages went unanswered and they didn\u2019t call as they said they would. Although a good place with very nice people, they are understaffed and that means that getting answers takes a bit more time. They deal only in wood, which is very nice. They have a nice selection of the more common types. This is not a glitzy place at all contrary to where I used to buy wood.\nI finally asked them to deliver the next Monday as I was going to be away on the Friday. I received almost everything on the Monday afternoon \u2013 was missing the desk top I had ordered. He came two days later with it, essentially after the storm that left about 40 cm of snow\u2026 While waiting for this, I started ripping and gluing up the boards for the shelves. I will need to research this process more as the results were not exactly what I was looking for. If anyone is willing to share his or her technique with me, I would be much obliged. I used biscuits to help line up the 8 foot boards and glued them together, reversing the grain to ensure that there would be minimal curvature. This seemed to work but there was some mismatch on the boards that required more sanding than I would like to do. I am thinking that I should do the glue ups prior to having the boards finished and then finish everything in the planer. Does that make any kind of sense? I\u2019ll need to experiment with cauls and also maybe cut the planks to close to finished lengths and glue them like that. Or keep the lengths to a maximum of 4 feet. I don\u2019t know. Following the glue-up, I cut all the shelves to rough size.\nI then went on to the plywood cabinets, the biggest piece of this whole setup. I cut down the 4\u00d78\u2032 sheets to rough size and finished then on the table saw. You see here the setup I used with my Festool TS-55. Fairly simple setup and works really well. Spent a day cutting all the plywood to size. The one error I made was on the inside shelves for the corner cabinet. This mistake was not very bad as I had tons of spare plywood already available from prior projects. The next day was spent on biscuits and routing the panels for the base cabinet. The last day was for all the edge banding and adjustable shelving holes to be drilled. Sanding was done at the end of all this. Wipe down with wet rag, let dry and sand with very fine grit (220) and then everything was ready for varnish.\nMy painting station is also my garage as you can see. So, everything was set up as I normally do this step and I started varnishing the first set of pieces. I can only do 12 at a time due to space and setup. I am thinking on how I can update and upgrade that setup. I think I have a few ideas but suggestions are welcomed!\nVarnishing was much longer than anticipated. It took me 2 full days with a paint gun and went through a full gallon of Varathane Diamond Wood Finish Satin. Lets just say that there is a lot of varnish on these parts. The very nice thing about my Fuji Q4 Gold is that it took only 6 minutes to apply a coat of varnish to all these pieces. This is a real time saver. The finish that I get is very smooth and nice. I love this kit. The process I use is I apply three coats of varnish with varying dry times between them. Typically, the second coat goes on about 30 minutes after the first one as the initial one dries very quickly. One hour later, the third coat goes on and that dries for at least 2 hours. I then sand everything down by hand using 220 grit sanding paper. I have used a different process for the shelves that will be used again in the future as it saved me tons of time. I then wipe everything down and give the fourth coat. This usually is the final one but for the top of the cabinets, I gave a light sanding and gave a fifth coat. The finish was amazing.\nThe next thing I did was to assemble the cabinets. This assembly included glue, biscuits and pocket hole joinery. It is fairly stable and strong. What was nice was to put in the pins and then slide in the shelves and see that everything fit just perfectly. Did I say I love SketchUp?\nI then moved on to the doors for the cabinets. I cut the stiles to width and size and then set up the router table to cut the tenons and grooves. I don\u2019t know how I ever lived without a router table. The setup was not too difficult to do and then I ran all the pieces at once. I did keep some wood templates for the next time I need to do doors. I\u2019m really happy with the doors. They are amazingly straight and true. Really happy.\nIt was then time for the real work to begin. I had been putting this off for a while for fear of the magnitude of the task. I had designed these and knew, up to a certain point, the necessary steps to do. So, I eventually jumped in and started it. Now for a bit of background. When I got the wood from the mill, I complained that the 1.5\u201d thick and 7\u201d wide boards for the library posts were crooked. I had made it abundantly clear that it needed to be straight. They told me that for the type of material I wanted, it was near impossible to have it straight for the length required (8 foot boards). So, I took it and then ripped all of the boards to correct width. Unfortunately, I had not checked the thickness of the planks and they were actually thicker than 1.5\u201d by about 1\/8\u201d. Well, that was a problem, a big one. More on that later.\nI therefore ripped the wide planks to width. I got a nasty surprise. The wood, still somewhat straight, started warping. There was nothing to do for it I though. So, I ripped everything and then sorted through the crooked and straighter posts. I marked the curves seen on the pieces to try to figure out how I was going to assemble all of this together. The most crooked I put aside and checked that a 7\u201d piece from these would be straight. These were used for the cross members of the libraries. I was less than happy. I ended up pairing the similarly curved posts so that, when the cross members were glued in between, the posts would see their curves nullified and I hoped I would end up with very straight library sides.\nI cut all the cross members to size first and ended up with a very nice stack. I then started to set up the table saw with the dado to make the numerous cuts to fashion them to their final look. This was a very repetitive process once the setup was done. This may sound benign but I was actually very stressed by this section of work. As this process was very repetitive, I was afraid of paying less attention to what I was doing and have two things happen: messing up a bunch of pieces and loosing one or more fingers due to inattention. Well, I\u2019m very good at scaring myself so I\u2019m happy to say that there were no mishaps. As I was stacking up the small cross member pieces, I noticed that the stack was not perfectly straight as it should be. This is when I realized that the posts I had cut were not perfectly square! My lack of verifying the dimensions came back to bite me in the proverbial derri\u00e8re. My width was dead on 1.5\u201d but the thickness of the original material was more than that. I had to break out the planer and get all the pieces through. That is how I created rejects as the planer destroyed some of them. I also put all the long posts through. Unfortunately, the pieces were not perfect so I had to take that into account at assembly. This also meant that the tenons I had cut were not all exactly square and some had to be recut once the cross members were planed to size. Much additional work but I did not loose too much material overall. Let\u2019s not forget I had not bought the extra 20% so couldn\u2019t redo anything without additional delay.\nThen came the mortises and the exacting calculations to ensure I put all the marks at the correct places. I calculated at least 5 times to make the final cuts. Everything went without a hitch. I was REALLY happy about that. What I thought would take only 2 days ended up taking 4.\nI proceeded to dry fit everything to ensure proper alignment and practice how I would be doing this considering glue was going to be involved. I needed to be precise and fast. I dry fitted everything, looked at the alignment and hoped that the technique of matching opposite curves would make things end up straight. Well, the glue up went well. I had to fight with some pieces but overall, I was happy with how things went. As you can see, I put three or four libraries together for clamping and curing. I had to wait for the unclamping to see if things would be straight. It worked! I was really happy. Everything was straight, no curves, flat and gorgeous!\nI moved on to the next scary part of this project, the shelves\u2026 I sanded them all down with my new toy, a Festool RO-150 FEQ. Wow! Is that tool the best ever sander! It has two settings, a rough sanding and a finish sanding. I used 80 grit sanding pads to make quick work of the misaligned boards and finished everything with 180 grit on fine orbital. Dust collection worked flawlessly in conjunction with the other toy, the CT-36. I now have a quiet(ish) dust extraction system for when I am sanding things. Unfortunately, I dropped my Osborne miter gauge on the floor and had to recalibrate it. There were a few shelves that ended up being cut crooked but I fixed it all. There weren\u2019t too many that I cut into a parallelogram. I cut the lip on the shelves and tested them on some extra cross members. The last thing was cutting the shoulders on the shelves.\nI varnished everything as I usually do but changed a component of the process. For the shelves, I decided to use my small Porter-Cable sander with a 220 grit paper instead of doing it by hand. Now, that was a great decision! Things went so much faster and that helped me make my weekend deadline. I also modified my holders to they could hold 5 shelves each, making it possible to varnish all 40 shelves in two days.\nThis project was officially finished on July 28th, 2013. It lasted a full 6 months, 4 months longer that intended. I learned many things while doing this project, many things about both myself and about the work processes. This project was the biggest I had ever taken on from the design perspective to execution to install. All steps were instructive and achievements in themselves. I have to say that I am extremely proud of this project. This is my second favorite. I loved it so much that I didn\u2019t really want to deliver it when it was ready. I do hope it will live on for many years and that it will bring aesthetic pleasure to their new owners. I will still be able to go see it once in a while and am really looking forward to see it full of books.\nBe well and enjoy what\u2019s left of summer!\nI just got my first contract to build bookcases and a desk for two rooms for a friend. These two items are my very first contracts. I am so excited and nervous.\nI was discussing what I did with a friend and she was interested in knowing more. She wanted to get my thoughts on what kind of libraries I would see her office. My girlfriend and I had brunch at her place where we discussed her house and the extensive remodelling that went into it. It is truly a beautiful home.\nWhile we were discussing things, I noticed a beautiful solid walnut library in their dining room. This thing was a least 14 feet long by about 9 feet high. The posts were 1.75\u2033 square and the shelves 1.5\u2033 thick. All solid walnut\u2026 Then they mentioned the table. Also solid walnut, about 2\u2033 thick with 4\u2033 legs. Let\u2019s just say I had to pick my jaw up from the ground and take care of the puddle of drool that came out. These items are simply gorgeous.\nWe discussed what they would like and the general feel of the whole concept. It needed to be airy and light. Solid wood was important. The room where this is going is white with natural birch flooring. There is a lot of light that comes into this room. Again, airiness was paramount.\nI worked on 6 different designs, from the boring looking to something a bit funky. What I also did was to recreate the dining room library look (pictures above). They loved it. This is what I will be tackling starting this week.\nI have to say that I may have been a bit too present in sending them designs and revisions. They were very gracious and never told me to go away. One thing I took care of doing was to listen to their comments on the existing library in the dining room. I was also careful to look at the other libraries they had around the house and inquiring what they liked and disliked about these. This enabled me to provide them with the plans you see above as well as a twist to it that solves both a problem they have with the solid walnut one and a structural issue that I was having.\nI devised the following locking system for the shelves. This provides both structural integrity and retention \u2013 all while giving a flat surface to put books on and the option of putting the shelves either at 12.75\u2033 or 6\u2033. I\u2019ve already made a template to see if it would work and it does!\nThe next thing that I will be figuring out is how to make all these cuts as reproducible and exact as possible while minimizing the various change in setup of the table saw. The shelves will need to be all ready before I start putting the grooves in.\nI was really pleased that they asked me to provide them with something similar for their son\u2019s room which will eventually become a study. The son has been warned!\nI will be updating the posts regularly as I progress with these two projects. I\u2019m really looking forward in getting the ordered wood and be making sawdust! I\u2019m also receiving a new toy for this project.\nI have loved photography for many years now. I have considered myself to be something of a \u201cpurist\u201d where I did not go for quantity with an electric motor, but more for quality, at least what I felt was quality for my expertise level. I bought the Toyo 45A in Toronto, at Vistek over 10 years ago. I used to own a F65, then a F80 which I gave to my friend and still own my F100. While I still was using these cameras, my favourite and most used was the Toyo. About 5 years ago, I bought a Hasselblad 501C Black Edition used but in mint condition. This camera was sold about 1 month ago. That was my 2nd go to camera.\nI also sold my darkroom which had an Omega D5-XL enlarger in it and more developing tanks than I care to list here. Let\u2019s just say that it was fully stocked. I spent many hours developing film and printing 20\u2033 x 24\u2033 prints, both B&W and Colour. Yes, colour. I loved it.\nHowever, for the past 2 \u2013 3 years, it was not getting used. None of my old school gear was getting used. It was collecting dust and giving me guilty feelings whenever I opened the closet door. I decided to post them on LesPac.com, an online classified website. I don\u2019t think I asked enough for them as they sold the very next day. I\u2019m more than happy to know that there are many \u201creal\u201d photographers still out there. Those that take the time to dive in chemistry and print something that smells and needs to dry. Knowing that someone will be fumbling with knobs under a dark cloth having people look at him funnily but with curiosity is really a good feeling.\nI remember the days of carrying this smallish 5 pound camera on my back with film holders, at least 10 giving me 20 shots, a changing bag, sheet film and my tripod \u2013 metal, about 3 pounds. I went up what passes for mountains around here. Carried it to the top of \u201cLes Draveurs\u201d trail in \u201cParc National des Hautes-Gorges\u201d or up \u201cParc National Les Grands Jardins\u201d during my yearly trips there. The best times were when there would be people coming up to me to ask about the camera. I would always let them touch and have a look under the cloth. They would be impressed by the size of the negative as well as the reversed and inverted image.\nThe Toyo saw the world with me. We went to Portugal, Spain, France, across Canada together. The Hassi saw even more \u2013 portability being sometimes more important. The Hassi was part of my last vacation in Italy. It photographed the \u201cBridge of Sighs\u201d without the photographer knowing what it was taking\u2026 A true friend.\nFilm and chemistry were becoming much harder to find. Actually, the chemistry availability actually plummeted these past few years. Talk about freedom from choice! I will miss the smell in my unventilated room. The smell on my fingers. Going to bed awfully late as I didn\u2019t pay attention to the time because I was so engrossed in the process. The magic of seeing the pictures starting to show in the developer bath. The happiness of seeing a reel of 6\u00d76 cm negatives come out of the tank or seeing the perfect greys of a newly developed 4\u00d75\u2033 negative. The tonality was simply amazing. I even considered building my own 8\u00d710\u2033\u2026 That never materialized.\nSo, as I said, it is the end of an era for me. I am now fully digital. I have my camera, a D800 (with the AA filter) and my Epson 4900 for prints. I am still converting my negatives using an Epson V700. That is a looooong process.\nI\u2019ve already taken quite a few pictures with the D800 that I like. I am discovering the use of the digital darkroom by using Lightroom. The picture at the top of my blog was taken in October 2012 with the D800 and modified in Lightroom. In a future post, I will be showing a few before\/after tinkerings.\nThank you Toyo, Hasselblad and Omega. Thank you Kodak, Fuji, Ilford for creating fantastic products. You will be missed.\nI first started woodworking some years ago in my father\u2019s basement. He had a Crafstman Radial Arm Saw and some hand tools. He did a lot of different things using these tools. He is of the \u201cfigure it out with what you have\u201d generation I would say. I\u2019m a wee bit more of the \u201cwhat tool can do this best\u201d generation myself. Now, I do think that I don\u2019t have many tools and use these in some innovative ways sometimes but I have to admit that I did spoil myself once or twice\u2026 I work hard so my hobbies need to be pleasurable, right? I will soon populate my WORKSHOP page so you will be able to see what tools I have and regularly work with. Some may say that I don\u2019t need all the tools I have and some may be surprised that I have so few, all things considered. I\u2019m really happy with what I have and all of it has seen very good use. I am now looking at upgrading my bandsaw. I currently have my father\u2019s old Beaver. It has seen a lot of use from him but very little from me. I did use it for a rather big project that I will be discussing in a later post and that made me decide to get a bigger and more powerful model. This has been \u201csomething to get\u201d for the past 6 years. I\u2019m a strong believer in getting the tools you need only when you have to. So far, I haven\u2019t had to but my next project is dependent on it.\nTo get back to the matter at hand, I started my woodworking hobby with this first easy piece. I was living in a very small apartment and needed a somewhat attractive place to put stuff. I have been an avid reader of Woodsmith and ShopNotes for the past 10 years and saw this storage chest. I found it to be just the right challenge for my new interest. I had just bought my table saw which I was keeping in my father\u2019s basement. At first, it did get more use from him than me\u2026 but I digress.\nThis chest was extremely straightforward to build. All that was needed was a sheet of 3\/4\u2033 plywood, about 16\u2032 of wooden mouldings and an 8\u2032 board of cherry. The main challenge for this chest was that I had not bought the correct hinges for it. However, as I am somewhat hard headed sometimes, I decided to use these and \u201cmake it work\u201d. This ended up in providing a nice detail to the chest.\nIt now resides in my godchild\u2019s bedroom keeping her toys safe.\nThis is my very first completely original design. I came about this design after researching many buffets from various manufacturers and never actually finding one that had all the things I was looking for. I decided to create my own.\nI used Google SketchUp 7 to create this item. It is made out of cherry stained to a dark chocolate color using Saman stains.\nCreating the Google SketchUp model: This was a bit of a challenge in itself. Because of this project, I have become fairly proficient with SketchUp! At least for straight lines\u2026 This model went through at least 18 revisions before I was happy with it and felt confident that I could build and assemble it alone in my shop.\nSelecting the wood: I went to my normal supplier, Langevin & Forest, to get the wood for the project. I selected unmilled lumber for this (a first) as well as plywood.\nMilling the wood: As I said, this was a first for me. I used my DeWalt DW735 thickness planer as well as my Delta 37-275X 6\u2033 jointer and went to work. I practiced on many scraps to get a feel for how to go about this. It ended up working really well and I will never go back. I had owned the DW735 for 3 years prior to this and had never used it, not even for a test\u2026 Imagine my glee as I saw the pieces of wood go in and then come out nice and smooth. It did take me a few passes before I understood that I needed to flip each piece every other pass so that I ended up with a straight board. My dust collector filled up very quickly as I had much material to mill.\nCutting wood: I then began to cut the pieces to size based on the printed plans. I have yet to find a better way of doing this. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m really happy with the quality of the prints coming out of SketchUp as the dimensions are difficult to read when you dimension things appropriately. Also, the actual printing is a chore. It may be just me but I need to find a better way of doing this. Cutting the various pieces was fairly straightforward. I believe that spending so much time in the design phase with SketchUp helped me better plan what needed to be cut when in the shop. I call this the IKEA phase. I find it fun to see all the parts together prior to assembly. Everything is sanded down and ready to go!\nComplicated parts: There were some complicated parts in this project. This piece is one of the more complicated parts that were produced with this project. I was amazed that it came out exactly as the SketchUp model said it would. You may be surprised by this but the actual confection of the piece was \u201cinteresting\u201d. The central groove was also in line with the rest of the grooves that were supposed to line up for the wine separators. All in all a perfect fit! I cannot thank the people at Google SketchUp enough for this free program. It is free and easy to use and is a fantastic tool for the woodworkers out there who want to create furniture. I have yet to explore its more advanced aspects.\nAssembly: This was a project in itself. Keeping in mind that this was done by one person alone, I had to ensure that the building made sense and was fairly straightforward with little necessity of extra hands. I was able to accomplish this by ensuring that the glue-up was done in sections. The most difficult part was to get the frame up and glued. I used compression straps to ensure that everything would stay in place while the clamps were put in place and tightened. As you can see, I was a bit innovative in the clamping style used. It worked and that is what counted.\nStain: I used my Fuji Q4 for stain for the first time. The results were surprisingly good, in my opinion. I used to do this step by hand prior to getting the gun. This was a pleasant experience as I was able to do all of the staining process in under 20 minutes. I mixed 2 parts of Saman Chocolate (#119) with one part of Saman Black (#108) Then came the varnish. I use Varathane Diamond Finish Satin for this piece as I wanted it to blend in with the rest of the dining room furniture we currently own \u2013 future project to be done, replacing this with something else, including chairs.\nThe Buffet is now filled with a collection of Whiskey, great wines and other spirits, its two drawers are being used for placemats and other smaller items.\nOverall, this is the nicest piece I have built, ever. This is the one I am most proud of. You will see in my other future posts other items I have created based on my designs, modified items I have seen as well as unmodified Woodsmith plans (most of my current furniture). I am now confident enough in my woodworking and drafting abilities to continue exploring new ideas of increasing complexity and personal usefulness.\nUltimately, for me, usefulness is the most important part of my woodworking. Every piece I craft need to serve a purpose and last a lifetime."}
{"text":"That makes it a most precious \u201capp\u201d today, in a world where everything is changing and so much is unknown. And yet, we don\u2019t seem to value questioning as much as we should.\nHere are some suggestions (based on input from question-friendly teachers, schools, programs, and organizations) on how to encourage more questioning in the classroom and hopefully, beyond it.\nTeachers, too, are embracing mobile personal technologies in order to improve their teaching methods, including offering online audio or video recordings of lectures, communicating with students and sharing course materials online.\nOne concern with technology in the classroom (cited by half of the students) is the fact that technology can sometimes be distracting. However, two thirds of them feel that technology helps them overcome the barriers imposed by large class sizes and still maintain personal contact with professors and teaching assistants.\nAdministrators in universities used to be people who would support academics in their role. Now it feels increasingly as if the administrative machine is, not only creating more work for themselves (under the guise of quality monitoring) but also more work for people who entered academia.\nI am afraid that this paper trail, which is based on the mentality of \"evaluate everything that moves,\" does not prove anything. It is a simulacrum of quality measuring rather than a real encouragement of a culture of quality, originality and excellence.\nWhere is all this going? Research, imagination, reflection and academic freedom are giving way to a generation that tries to measure and evaluate what it cannot understand.\nSuddenly, as you may have noticed, millennials are everywhere. Not that this group of people born after 1980 and before 2000 \u2014 a giant cohort now estimated to number at least 80 million Americans, more than the baby boom generation \u2014 was ever invisible.\nWhat\u2019s changed is their status. Coddled and helicoptered, catered to by 24-hour TV cable networks, fussed over by marketers and college recruiters, dissected by psychologists, demographers and trend-spotters, the millennial generation has come fully into its own.\nWhy this microscopic attention paid to a generation whose oldest members are only now entering the prime of their adult lives? One answer is that millennials, the first people to come of age in the 21st century, with its dizzying rate of technological change, have been forced to invent new ways of navigating it.\nOut of all the students who enroll in a MOOC, only about 5 percent complete the course and receive a certificate of accomplishment. This statistic is often cited as evidence that MOOCs are fatally flawed and offer little educational value to most students.\nYet more than 80 percent of students who fill out a post-course survey say they met their primary objective. How do we reconcile these two facts?\nFocusing on the tiny fraction of students who complete a MOOC is misguided. The more important number is the 60 percent engagement rate. Students may not finish a MOOC with a certificate of accomplishment, but the courses nonetheless meet the educational goals of millions.\nPalabras Clave: Educaci\u00f3n en l\u00ednea."}

At least 30,000 letters were also sent in error, City Hall said this week \u2014 after initially blaming the Board of Elections for compiling a bad list.\nThe mistake caused a brief panic among some voters, who then flooded the Board of Elections wondering if there was a voting scam underway.\nDe Blasio acknowledged Friday that the city had mismanaged the effort \u2014 the first spearheaded by the recently created \u201cDemocracy NYC\u201d office, which de Blasio created as part of his push to increase civic involvement.\n\u201cThere is no question that this was a good idea where there was a problem in the execution,\u201d de Blasio said Friday during his weekly appearance on \"The Brian Lehrer Show. \"\n\u201cWith the information that I have today, 8 percent of the names should not have been on that list, but if that proves to be true in the end, that means 92 percent of the names were people that needed to be reached out to,\u201d he said.\nThe city paid upward of $20,000 for a list of names from third party software vendor Civis Analytics, which procured the list from the Board of Elections.

If successful, the long shot Buttigieg would be the first openly gay person to win the Democratic presidential nomination and the White House.\nLGBT priorities for Buttigieg, who said he\u2019d run a campaign based on the themes of freedom, democracy and security, include passage of the Equality Act and greater visibility for transgender people.\nDistinguishing himself from other 2020 hopefuls, Buttigieg said he supports transgender people having access to transition-related care, even when they\u2019re in prison. Other candidates, including Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, have different records on that issue.\nWashington Blade: You\u2019re running in a field of Democratic candidates, many of whom have been longtime LGBT allies. What do you bring to the table that\u2019s different?\nPete Buttigieg: First of all, I\u2019m very mindful of the possibility of being the first out nominee in American history, and you know, I think it\u2019s safe to say for many reasons, I\u2019m not like the others.\nI also just have a different outlook: I am from the industrial Midwest, I\u2019m in local government and I come from a generation that I think really needs to be stepping forward right now. I think our generation has so much at stake in the future and the decisions that are being made today, and I think it really shows the people in charge, like the current president and administration, don\u2019t care very much about the future because they don\u2019t plan to be here.\n2054 is the year when I will reach the current age of the current president, and I think you just take some of these decisions about climate, about the economy much more seriously if you\u2019re hoping to be here in 2054.\nWhat we have here right now is a sequence of decisions that have been made that are very short term, very destructive and it\u2019s time for voices from a generation that has a personal stake in that future to step forward and talk about how we can make that future different.\nBlade: But what makes you think you can win the White House if you get the nomination?\nButtigieg: I think the message needs to revolve around three themes: freedom, democracy and security. I think that you have a very strong, progressive foundation for those issues, but I also think we\u2019ve not done a very good job of communicating them across the aisle.\nFreedom is something that I think has been monopolized by conservatives in terms of political rhetoric, but when I think about everything from the freedom to marry to the freedom to start a new business knowing you can still get health care, it\u2019s really progressive and Democrats have delivered the kinds of freedom that are most important for our daily lived experience.\nWhen it comes to democracy, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we are the party that is more interested in making sure that more people can vote, and I think this needs to be part of a national conversation as well. We need to shore up our democracy through a number of reforms, including D.C. statehood, that just make our democratic republic a little more democratic.\nAnd then on security, we\u2019ve got to understand 21st century security means a lot more than just border security and traditional military issues. I was in the military. I certainly spent a lot of time thinking about traditional military issues, but we have to be talking about cybersecurity, election security, climate security, digital security. And I think people are ready for a message that\u2019s just different from what we\u2019ve had before.\nWe have a profoundly, almost historically, unpopular president, but that doesn\u2019t mean he gets defeated on his own if we don\u2019t have a compelling message that\u2019s different and better.\nBlade: Let\u2019s bring this closer to our LGBT readers. How does support for the LGBT community figure into your run for the presidency?\nButtigieg: I think that it will be vital. I think it will be a spruce of lifeblood because we are perhaps the only minority in more or less equal proportion across every racial, ethnic, economic and geographic group in the country, so one thing that will be very important for the success of this project, especially early on when people take your measure based on fundraising is to be able to demonstrate grassroots support from people in the community who believe that representation at the highest levels, actually having someone from the LGBTQ community on the ballot is important, that it will make things better for the next person who comes along and that America needs to be given a chance to demonstrate that it\u2019s ready for this.\nBlade: In terms of LGBT rights issues, where do you want to go with that?\nButtigieg: I think one of the big things that we\u2019re looking at, of course, is the Equality Act. I live in a state where it is still \u2014 not in South Bend because we took local action, but in most parts of my state it\u2019s still perfectly legal to be fired for who you are, and I think we need better legislation, civil rights legislation that takes care of that.\nObviously, we have a lot of issues with hate crimes now in Indiana. At the state level, we\u2019ve been pursuing hate crimes legislation. We have federal hate crimes legislation, but we have to do a lot more, including, not just at the policy level, but at the cultural level. There\u2019s several reasons why hate crimes have gone up by most measures in recent years, and I think, a lot of that starts at the top. It has to do with leadership, it has to do with the tone that it set by those in charge and it has to change.\nBlade: What concerns you most about how President Trump is handling LGBT issues?\nButtigieg: Obviously the attack on trans rights and the trans military ban is extremely disturbing. When I was in the military, the people I served with could not have cared less whether I was going home to a girlfriend or boyfriend. They just wanted to know that I was going to be someone they could trust with their lives and vice-versa.\nTrans members of the military who are willing to put their lives on the line in order to defend this country deserve to be supported by their commander in chief, and it\u2019s extremely disturbing, especially for someone who, let\u2019s face it, kind of pink-washed his campaign early on and portrayed himself as somebody who might change the way the Republican Party related to the LGBT community to turn around and do this demonstrates that he was never serious about that, not to mention the elevation of Mike Pence to one heartbeat away from the presidency.\nBlade: What kind of place will transgender people have in your campaign and your presidency?\nButtigieg: A very prominent place. I\u2019ve been really heartened to see more people, especially in my generation, stepping forward. I think Danica Roem opened a lot of doors in terms of elected leadership, and I think we will be looking to make sure that our campaign as well as a future administration reflects the diversity of this country. Obviously, that includes making sure there are visible roles for trans people.\nBlade: One question I want to pose to you because it has been a point of differentiation among the Democratic candidates: Should transgender people, even if they\u2019re in prison, have access to gender reassignment surgery?\nButtigieg: Yeah. I believe that\u2019s part of health care. We provide health care to people who are serving the country, we provide health care to people who are incarcerated. I think the bigger issue is that too many people are incarcerated, but if you are, we need to treat everybody the same, and if you regard this, as I do, as part of health care.\nLook, people try to turn others against this around the issue of cost, but the spectacular costs of incarceration have very little to do with things like gender reassignment.\nBlade: Are you aware Kamala Harris as California attorney general defended the California Department of Corrections in seeking to deny surgery to transgender inmates and what do you make of that?\nButtigieg: I was not aware of that. I do know that California, if I understand correctly, is one of the few places that has been able to provide that, and I think that the rationale for it is based on it being \u2014 not only that it can be medically necessary for many inmates, but also there are shockingly high rates of sexual assaults or sexual abuse for transgender people who are incarcerated, so I think that moving in that direction was the right thing to do and I hope that more states take a look at that, especially the ones that want to ensure that we\u2019re preventing sexual abuse.\nBlade: What kind of endorsements has your potential candidacy obtained so far and how do you expect them to grow?\nButtigieg: Obviously, this is a very early phase. We just announced the exploratory committee last Wednesday, but we are going to seek endorsements from organizations and individuals. We\u2019ve already reached out to the Victory Fund, to the Human Rights Campaign and to a lot of the people I respect and talked about.\nRightly, they are taking their time and they\u2019re being very deliberate about this, but I do hope that we will earn that and demonstrate somebody like me belongs in this conversation at the highest level. Hopefully, we will continue to mobilize the support we need in order to be taken seriously.\nThis first quarter is critical because this is where we establish that we belong at the table, then it becomes a matter, once we\u2019ve shown enough early organizational support at the end of the quarter, then we no longer have to answer questions about whether we belong in the conversation and start really focusing on making sure that what we have to say in the conversation justifies more and more support.\nBlade: What will it take for you to move from an exploratory committee to a candidacy in the legal sense?\nButtigieg: I want us to be in a position to have a very strong launch coming out of the gate both in terms of the sort of event we are launching and in terms of the organizational support we have on Day One of that phase, that we\u2019re right where we want to be.\nBlade: I\u2019ve had experts tell me you face challenges because you don\u2019t have the name recognition of other candidates and you should run for governor and not president. What would you say to that?\nI just don\u2019t believe that you run for office because you would love to have it or because you think it\u2019s the right step along the way because these offices are too important. You run for office because you think what you have meets the moment, and every time I\u2019ve decided to run for office and every time I\u2019ve decided not to run for an office has been the outcome of that same process of discernment.\nBlade: Has anyone told you a gay person cannot be elected president in the year 2020?\nButtigieg: Yes. Some believe that\u2019s the case, and I think there is only one way to demonstrate conclusively that that\u2019s not true.\nBlade: If there are LGBT people or people anywhere who want to support you, what is the biggest way to help out?\nButtigieg: So, peteforamerica.com is the place where you can add your name to the list, if you want to be on the list so we know you\u2019re a supporter, if you want to make a financial contribution, which again, right now, in terms of showing we belong at the table, part of how they take your measure is that grassroots financial support.\nOver time, especially in early states, we will need help on the ground getting known, making introductions, winning people over and then hopefully as that grows, more and more of a field organization that will have all kinds of roles for people, but you can start by going to peteforamerica.com and adding your name so we know who\u2019s out there to support us."}
{"text":"even though it\u2019s been a month, I cannot wrap my head around the fact that the world has lost one of the most genuine and heartfelt artists in the industry. growing up, my parents were constantly blasting music through the sound system that was connected to every room on every floor in our house. Joe Cocker\u2019s music was some of the earliest music i can remember listening to. my parents were crazy about him & i swear, definitely enjoyed playing air guitar and drums more than letting their kids sleep in on the weekends. i mean, they started blasting AC\/DC, KISS, Joe Cocker & Led Zeppelin at like 8 am on Saturdays & Sundays & it didn\u2019t stop until the family was all seated at the table for dinner. Joe Cocker\u2019s music became some of my favorite music instantly & i found myself getting pulled in by the rawness of his vocals. his live album \u2018Mad Dogs and Englishmen\u201d has to be one of the greatest live rock & roll albums to ever be recorded & inspired me immensely as a child to wanna be a singer.\nanyway, i could go on & on about this guy & his music, but the most significant impact his music had on my life was the self esteem & reassurance that his version of \u2018You Are So Beautiful\u2019 provided for me. my mom said this had always been one of her favorite songs & once she had kids, his version of that song reminded her of \u201cher little beautiful babies\u201d & thus my parents sang me to sleep every night with that song. as a kid, falling asleep to the words \u201cyou are so beautiful to me, can\u2019t you see? you\u2019re everything i hoped for, you\u2019re everything i need\u201d totally erased all feelings of self doubt & self-consciousness. to this day, his version is still my all-time favorite song.\ni wish i got to meet you, dude. your music has changed my life in so many ways & i\u2019m more than thankful for that alone. i hope you rest in paradise knowing that your music will live on forever. we will miss ya, Joe Cocker."}
{"text":"Jay Z has a verse on the latest DJ Khaled track, which may or may not include a diss aimed at Drake (in response to that whole fondue plate thing): \"Haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my drawstring \/ Wrong sport, boy, you know you soft as a lacrosse team.\" But instead of drawing Drake's ire, Jay's line has gotten the bros who run Major League Lacrosse all riled up.\n\"Lacrosse is often called the fastest sport on two feet. Players are on the field dodging and shooting balls at over 100 miles per hour,\" a MLL spokesperson told MTV News in a written statement issued on Tuesday (April 29).\n\"With that said we don't think Jay-Z knows what he's talking about when he calls Lacrosse 'soft' I can guarantee you it is anything but a 'soft' sport,\" the statement continued.\nTo top it all off, MLL issues a challenge to the battle-tested MC. \"Mr. Carter would not last one minute on a lacrosse field during a match and he is more than welcome to come to any of our games and try,\" the statement read in closing.\nOK, lax bros, we get it. Your sport is super tough and cool. We are all taking this spirited defense to heart while making sure that you cannot see our dismissive wanking."}
{"text":"I arrived in the darkest hour of the night. The streets were silent but for the swaying silhouette branches \u2013 it took me a moment to realise there was a blackout in the streets. It was midnight and I closed the car door quietly. Sound was now my greater sense, the trees sounded like waves in the ocean. The breeze was cool and a shiver ran up my arm as I opened the front door.\nI fumbled for the torch near the door, outlined in the previous text from Dawn. I felt my way down the hall and shone the torch into the ceiling to find Beau curled up in his bed, arms up on his pillow near his face. I went to the spare room and undressed and lay in bed listening to the sounds of the house and the trees outside.\n\u2018Mum? Mum, Mum\u2026\u2019 I sat up in bed. My ear was facing the door. Beau was calling out and his words followed each other closely. I looked at my phone, I\u2019d had half an hour of sleep. I walked into his room.\n\u2018Dad! Where\u2019s Mum?\u2019 he was upright.\n\u2018She\u2019s in bed sweetheart, I just got here\u2019 I kissed his forehead. \u2018Lay back down and sleep\u2019, he turned over and I stroke his back.\nI went back to bed, the trees were scratching the roof and the wind was trying to open the blinds in my room.\nI must have slept through the night. I woke up as Beau was climbing into the spare bed beside me and immediately he describes his soccer triumphs from the night before and how he saved a goal \u2013 all the while holding my hand in bed. It was barely light outside.\nAs weekends go, it wasn\u2019t extraordinary. There was backyard soccer, cheese and tomato toasted sandwiches and wrestling with brushing teeth and homework, but he was constantly at my side. Leaning his head on my shoulder watching tv, clasping my fingers into his hand and when I gave the final cuddle in the back yard and said good bye, he silently walked into the house and sat down next to his mother.\nI clicked my fingers to get Dawns attention and she immediately realised what was wrong just by looking at him. We both jovially moved about the kitchen, both fake.\nHe followed me down the stairs to my car and stood while I put my bag on the front seat. I made small talk \u2013 perhaps for my sake.\n\u2018Ok my love\u2019 I pulled him in for one last hug. Chicky tiptoed across the patchy grass to join his brother.\nI drove up the road and two little boys ran alongside on the curb waving. The autumn sun shining onto their faces as they waved. I drove slowly and watched them run back home, the cool breeze seemingly pushing the sun down faster.\nPrevious post Are Liberals ready to say \u2018I do\u2019?"}

{"text":"-a bag I recently bought- although it was marketed towards women first, (I bought it in a thrift store for an equivalent of 30 cents ) it looks quite gender- ambiguous.\nIt's just my imagination and I still don't have lipstick nor nail polish, but I think I could pull such a look off. I'd like to express myself and shock some people who believe in gender binary :-D.\nHowever, it sounds like your idea is pretty far from regular guy mode, especially with lipstick, gloves and handbag. Just sounds more on the side of dressing to look like a woman?\nWell, I think that'd be \"balancing on the ledge\" between masculinity and feminity. I call this \"a man dressed as a woman who's dressed as a man\" :-D So... No \"true en femme mode\", fake breasts, wigs etc., just some stereotypically feminine items, but with keeping my identity .\nWhat does \"binary\" about this context? One's femaleness or maleness has nothing to do with what clothing you wear. The makeup and bag idea, that's not \"drag.\" If makeup and a handbag are \"feminine,\" then wouldn't ANYTHING worn by a man that has somehow gotten associated with women over the years be \"feminine,\" including heels?\nWhat does \"binary\" about this context? One's femaleness or maleness has nothing to do with what clothing you wear.\nElegant, can you put the photo's back into this thread because without them, this entire thread doesnt make sense now?\nHaving come late to the heels4men party I missed the pics so can't comment. Not sure about makeup on men though it was big in the 80's, and made a bit of a comeback sometime more recently.\nEveryone in movies has makeup on, so that's not a good example. But I do agree that the gender lines are being blurred more and more in a lot of areas. Men are spending more time on their appearance now, I think that the workplace has changed which is expediting this trend. To clarify that, more men are working in office jobs (in the West anyway) instead of manual labour which means they can spend time on their look without it being a waste of time when they get to work and ruin it all. Now they can have a manicure (which seems to be getting more popular I notice) and it won't get messed up digging coal, or laying bricks.\nWill makeup follow this trend pattern, or are men not vain enough yet?\nElegant, we are on the same page 100% equality in fashions is what I push for my self on facebook, people should be able to wear what they wish..I have gone to party's wearing my black Stillwater kilt mens pantyhose and knee high heel boots with a dress jacket and the look I showed the lady's thought the look was goth chic and loved it. Here are some pictures of the boots and the kilt, the kilt pic. was taken at the Comic Con here in San Diego."}
